jesus christ is the strength of parents by elder dieter f uchtdorf of the quorum of the twelve apostles help your children build faith in jesus christ love his gospel and his church and prepare for a lifetime of righteous choices once upon a time a father was about to leave for an evening bishopric meeting his fouryearold daughter stepped in front of him wearing pajamas and holding a copy of book of mormon stories why do you have to go to a meeting she asked because i am a counselor in the bishopric he answered but you are my dad his daughter protested he knelt in front of her sweetheart he said i know you want me to read to you and help you go to sleep but tonight i need to help the bishop his daughter replied doesnt the bishop have a dad to help him go to sleep we are eternally grateful for the countless members who serve diligently in the church of jesus christ every day your sacrifice is truly sacred but as this girl seemed to understand theres something equally sacredsomething irreplaceableabout a parent nurturing a child it reflects the pattern of heaven1 our father in heaven our divine parent surely rejoices when his children are taught and nurtured by their parents on earth2 parents thank you for everything youre doing to raise your children and children thank you for everything youre doing to raise your parents because as every parent knows we often learn as much from our children about faith hope and charity as they learn from us3 parents have a sacred duty have you ever thought about the tremendous risk our father in heaven takes each time he sends a child to earth these are his spirit sons and daughters they have limitless potential they are destined to become glorious beings of goodness grace and truth and yet they come to earth completely helpless barely able to do anything besides cry for help the memory of their time in gods presence is veiled over along with the knowledge of who they really are and who they can become they form their understanding of life love god and his plan based on what they observe from the people around themespecially their parents who honestly are still trying to figure things out for themselves imagenewborn baby god has given parents the sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness to provide for their physical and spiritual needs and to teach them to observe the commandments of god4 thats enough to keep even the best parents awake at night my message to all parents is this the lord loves you he is with you he stands beside you he is your strength in guiding your children to make righteous choices accept this privilege and responsibility courageously and joyfully dont delegate this source of heavenly blessings to anyone else within the framework of gospel values and principles you are the ones to guide your child in the details of daily decisions help your children build faith in jesus christ love his gospel and his church and prepare for a lifetime of righteous choices in fact that is gods plan for parents satan will oppose you distract you try to discourage you but every child has received the light of christ as a direct line to heaven and the savior will help you guide you and encourage you seek his help inquire of the lord imagethe lord jesus christ just as jesus christ is the strength of youth jesus christ is also the strength of parents he magnifies love sometimes we might wonder if someone else might be better qualified to guide and teach our children but no matter how inadequate you may feel you have something that uniquely qualifies you your love for your child a parents love for a child is one of the strongest forces in the universe its one of the few things on this earth that can truly be eternal now perhaps you feel that your relationship with your child is less than ideal thats where the saviors power comes in he heals the sick and he can heal relationships he multiplies bread and fish and he can multiply the love and the joy in your home your love for your children creates a rich environment for teaching truth and building faith make your home a house of prayer learning and faith a house of joyful experiences a place of belonging a house of god5 and pray unto the father with all the energy of heart that you may be filled with his love which he bestows upon followers of his son jesus christ6 he magnifies small and simple efforts another strength you have as a parent is the opportunity for daily ongoing influence peers teachers and media influencers come and go but you can be the most constant steady influence in your childs life your efforts may seem small compared to the loud voices your children hear in the world at times it may feel that youre not accomplishing much but remember that by small means the lord can bring about great things7 one home evening one gospel conversation or one good example may not change your childs life in a moment any more than one drop of rain causes a plant immediately to grow but the consistency of small and simple things day after day nourishes your children much better than an occasional flood8 that is the lords way he speaks to you and your child with a still small voice not a voice of thunder9 he healed naaman not through some great thing but through the simple repeated act of washing10 the children of israel enjoyed the feast of quail in the wilderness but what kept them alive was the small and simple miracle of mannatheir daily bread11 brothers and sisters daily bread is best prepared and served at home faith and testimony are best fostered in normal and natural ways one bite at a time in small and simple moments in the constant flow of daily living12 every moment is a teaching moment every word and action can be a guide for making choices13 you may not see the immediate effects of your efforts but dont give up all things must come to pass in their time the lord said wherefore be not weary in welldoing for you are laying the foundation of a great work14 what work could be greater than helping gods precious children learn who they really are and build their faith in jesus christ his gospel and his church jesus christ will bless and magnify your consistent efforts he gives revelation another powerful way the lord supports parents is through the gift of personal revelation god is eager to pour out his spirit to guide parents as you are prayerful and sensitive to the spirit he will warn you of hidden dangers15 he will reveal your childrens gifts their strengths and their unspoken concerns16 god will help you see your children as he sees thembeyond their outward appearance and into their hearts17 with gods help you can learn to know your children in a pure and heavenly way i invite you to accept gods offer to guide your family by personal revelation seek his guidance in your prayers18 a mighty change perhaps the most important help jesus christ offers to parents is the mighty change of heart19 its a miracle every one of us needs for a moment imagine this situation youre at church listening to a talk about families the speaker describes a perfect home and an even more perfect family husband and wife never quarrel children stop reading their scriptures only when its time to do homework and the music of love one another20 is playing in the background before the speaker gets to the part about everyone cheerfully joining to clean the bathroom youre already thinking my family is hopeless dear brothers and sisters relax everyone in the congregation is thinking the same thing the fact is all parents worry about not being good enough fortunately there is a divine source of help for parents it is jesus christ he is the source of our mighty change of heart as you open your heart to the savior and his teachings he will show you your weakness if you trust jesus christ with a humble heart he will make weak things become strong21 he is the god of miracles does that mean you and your family will be pictureperfect no but you will get better through the saviors grace little by little youll develop more of the attributes parents need love for god and his children patience selflessness faith in christ and courage to make righteous choices jesus christ offers support through his church our effort to build faith in jesus christ is home centered focused on the individual and it is church supported besides providing the sacred scriptures and the words of prophets the saviors church offers many resources to help parents and children make righteous choices imagefor the strength of youth a guide for making choices for the strength of youth a guide for making choices does not give you a list of dos or donts it teaches eternal truths to help make choices centered on the life and teachings of jesus christ read it with your children let them talk about it help them to have these eternal and divine truths guide their choices22 fsy conferences are another wonderful resource i hope every youth will attend i invite young single adults to join these conferences as mentors and counselors i invite parents to build on the spiritual momentum their youth bring home from fsy conferences children and youth in the church of jesus christ of latterday saints have teachers advisers and mentors often you enter a young persons life at a crucial moment to build and support faith and testimony some of you are single adults some never had children of your own your joyful service to gods children is sacred in gods eyes23 never give up on the miracle my dear friends my dear brothers and sisters building faith in a child is somewhat like helping a flower grow you cannot tug on the stem to make it taller you cannot pry open the bud to get it to blossom sooner and you cannot neglect the flower and expect it to grow or flourish spontaneously what you can and must do for the rising generation is provide rich nourishing soil with access to flowing heavenly water remove weeds and anything that would block heavenly sunlight create the best possible conditions for growth patiently allow the rising generation to make inspired choices and let god work his miracle the result will be more beautiful and more stunning and more joyful than anything you could accomplish just by yourself in heavenly fathers plan families relationships are meant to be eternal this is why as a parent you never give up even if you are not proud of how things went in the past with jesus christ the master healer and savior there can always be a new beginning he always gives hope jesus christ is the strength of families jesus christ is the strength of youth jesus christ is the strength of parents of this i testify in the name of jesus christ amen notes innate in almost every parent is the desire to teach his or her children moral virtues this is part of the miracle of heavenly fathers plan he wants his children to come to earth following the eternal pattern of families that exists in heaven families are the basic organizational unit of the eternal realms and so he intends for them also to be the basic unit on earth though earthly families are far from perfect they give gods children the best chance to be welcomed to the world with the only love on earth that comes close to what we felt in heavenparental love families are also the best way to preserve and pass on
