generations linked in love by elder russell m nelson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder russell m nelson our inborn yearnings for family connections are fulfilled when we are linked to our ancestors through sacred ordinances of the temple correspondence we receive at easter or christmastime provides refreshing memories of dear friends and relatives some of those messages are enriched with precious family photographs here is one that really caught my attention this is one of our greatgranddaughters ill call her dear ruby this picture reminded me of her mother when she was about the same age from my files i retrieved this photo of dear rubys motherone of our granddaughters i took this picture of dear rubys mother some 29 years ago her eyes are still just as blue fond memories surfaced from half a century ago when dear rubys grandmotherone of our daughterswas then the newest member of our family this is one of her baby pictures now she is a loving grandmother and i am dear rubys greatgrandfather i wont show you my picture as a baby that would not help these photographs suggest the love that links our four generations together when i think of the love i feel for each member of our family i sense to a slight degree the love that our heavenly father bears for his children while the family is under attack throughout the world the church of jesus christ of latterday saints proclaims promotes and protects the truth that the family is central to the creators plan for the eternal destiny of his children the family a proclamation to the world and our vast family history efforts are but two evidences of how this church brings hope and help to the sacred institution of the family we teach that gods love for his children is infinite regardless of race nationality or gender he loves all of them1 he has done so from the beginning and will continue to do so he invites all to gain eternal exaltation for their family his work and his glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal lifethe exaltationof his children2 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life3 the atonement of his beloved son enabled both of the fathers objectives to be fulfilled without the atonement there would be no immortality without the atonement there would be no return to the presence of the father and no continuation of the family beyond the grave because of the atonement these consummate blessings can be realized by each of gods children who obey his eternal laws through the ages many of his children have had access to the blessings of the gospel but many more have not before the foundation of the world our heavenly father instituted the ordinance of baptism for those who die without a knowledge of the gospel4 he loves those children too he also provided a way for them to be part of an eternal family every human being who comes to this earth is the product of generations of parents we have a natural yearning to connect with our ancestors this desire dwells in our hearts regardless of age consider the spiritual connections that are formed when a young woman helps her grandmother enter family information into a computer or when a young man sees the name of his greatgrandfather on a census record when our hearts turn to our ancestors something changes inside us we feel part of something greater than ourselves our inborn yearnings for family connections are fulfilled when we are linked to our ancestors through sacred ordinances of the temple because of the importance of this work the church has built temples closer to the people5 and family history research is being facilitated as never before methods to find and prepare names for temple ordinances are also improving at the october 2005 conference president gordon b hinckley announced an exciting step forward in family history and temple work he said one of the most troublesome aspects of our temple activity is that as we get more and more temples across the earth there is duplication of effort in proxy work we therefore have been engaged for some time in a very difficult undertaking the solution lies in complex computer technology6 since then not only has duplication been reduced but procedures have been simplified so that virtually every member of the church can participate in temple and family history work gone are the days when this sacred work was done only by specialists no matter your situation you can make family history a part of your life right now primary children can draw a family tree youth can participate in proxy baptisms they can also help the older generation work with computers parents can relate stories of their lives to their posterity worthy adult members can hold a temple recommend and perform temple ordinances for their own kin the prophet joseph smith said the greatest responsibility in this world that god has laid upon us is to seek after our dead7 new technology makes it easier than ever to fulfill that responsibility temple and family history work is now facilitated by a system known as the new familysearch8 this internetbased system helps members identify their ancestors determine what ordinance work needs to be done for them and prepare their names for the temple it can be accessed from home a family history center9 or wherever the internet is available the steps are easy to follow10 you first identify individuals for whom you desire to do temple work then you print out a family ordinance request this document provides the information needed at the temple and eliminates the need to take computer discs with you from the family ordinance request ordinance cards are printed at the temple after an ordinance is performed it is recorded and entered into new familysearch on that very day now what about those of you who have no access to a computer or prefer not to use this technology dont worry take one step at a time start at home begin with an empty cardboard box as suggested by president boyd k packer11 put in that box important information about you and your family add data gathered from others of your family then avail yourself of assistance from your ward or branch family history consultant the new familysearch system enables a consultant to perform all needed computer functions for you including preparing names for the temple about 60000 consultants serve throughout the world one in your ward or branch can be very helpful to you the new familysearch system changes the dynamics of family history work by facilitating the creation of one common pedigree in the past a person worked separately keeping his or her own family records one often worked without knowing what other family members were doing now each person can contribute information while coordinating with others in developing their family tree while the new familysearch is a giant step forward it is still just a step there is more work ahead because the system facilitates access to information submitted to the church over many decades from many sources new familysearch may expose duplicate entries or errors that had not previously been recognized this feature is especially useful for those with early pioneer ancestry duplications and errors need correction and no one can do it better than each individual for his or her own family you may be frustrated as you work through these challenges please be assured that your concerns are well understood the church under the inspired leadership of president thomas s monson is working diligently to assist you in solving these problems together we are striving to organize the family tree for all of gods children this is an enormous endeavor with enormous rewards this is joyful work look at this photograph of new converts doing temple work for their own kin these dear saints are from the san salvador el salvador ilopango stake and are attending the guatemala city temple for the first time they are holding their temple cards each with the name of a deceased relative for whom they have performed a vicarious baptism in order for the churchs family history efforts to succeed priesthood direction and leadership are essential leaders teach and testify of the doctrine undergirding this sacred work12 they issue callings and see that instruction is available13 they view temple and family history activity as a way to elevate the spirit of their ward strengthen the spiritual roots of new converts and bless the lives of all members while temple and family history work has the power to bless those beyond the veil it has an equal power to bless the living it has a refining influence on those who are engaged in it they are literally helping to exalt their families we are exalted when we can dwell together with our extended families in the presence of almighty god the prophet joseph smith foresaw our duty the great day of the lord is at hand he said let us therefore as a church and a people and as latterday saints offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness and let us present in his holy temple a book containing the records of our dead which shall be worthy of all acceptation14 the preparation of that record is our individual and collective responsibility as we work together we can make it worthy of all acceptation by the lord that record enables ordinances to be performed for and accepted by our deceased ancestors as they may choose those ordinances can bring liberty to captives on the other side of the veil15 our children grandchildren dear ruby and all our greatgrandchildren are linked in love they are also linked in love to ancestors those links welded through sacred ordinances lead to the exaltation of our families16 that this sacred goal may be realized for each of us is my prayer in the name of jesus christ amen notes see 1 corinthians 1213 galatians 328 2 nephi 2633 see moses 139 john 316 see doctrine and covenants 12433 president thomas s monson said recently that 83 percent of church members throughout the world now live within 200 miles 320 km of a temple see welcome to conference
