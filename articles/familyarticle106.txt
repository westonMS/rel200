sacred homes sacred temples by elder gary e stevenson of the seventy imageelder gary e stevenson understanding the eternal nature of the temple will draw you to your family understanding the eternal nature of the family will draw you to the temple what a wonderful conference it has been how blessed we are to hear the counsel of the first presidency and the quorum of the twelve whom we sustain as prophets seers and revelators i remember a warm sunny afternoon when spring was trying to nudge its way through a long winter in cache valley utah my father whose saturdays were always filled with chores for his grandsons stopped by our home with an offer to go for a ride always happy to ride in grandpas truck our four and sixyearold sons scurried into the back jump seat and i joined my father in the front our drive took us through the streets of downtown logan which wrap around the logan temple prominently situated on a hill centered beautifully in the city as we moved further away from the city we turned from paved busy streets to seldomused dirt roads where we crossed old bridges and weaved through trees far into the country we were far from any other traffic and all alone realizing his grandsons were in a place they had not been before my father stopped the truck do you think we are lost he asked the wideeyed boys as they gazed out the windshield across the valley followed by a moment of silent assessment came the profound reply of a young child look he said pointing his finger grandpa you are never lost when you can see the temple our eyes turned focusing with his seeing the sun glistening off the spires of the logan temple far across the valley you are never lost when you can see the temple the temple will provide direction for you and your family in a world filled with chaos it is an eternal guidepost which will help you from getting lost in the mist of darkness1 it is the house of the lord2 it is a place where covenants are made and eternal ordinances are performed in the book of mormon king benjamin directed the saints of his time and place to gather every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple3 as church members we have recently received counsel from modernday prophets which if followed will turn the doors of our homes more fully towards the temple the first presidency has invited adult members to have a current temple recommend and visit the temple more often where time and circumstance permit and encouraged members to replace some leisure activities with temple service they also encouraged newer members and youth of the church who are 12 years of age and older to live worthy to assist in this great work by serving as proxies for baptisms and confirmations4 even our young children have been encouraged to visit the temple grounds and touch the temple5 president thomas s monson once counseled as we touch the temple the temple will touch us6 we are blessed to live in a templebuilding dispensation in which 146 temples have been dedicated or announced7 under the definition of temple in the bible dictionary we read the following it is the most holy of any place of worship on the earth followed by this insightful statement only the home can compare with the temple in sacredness8 for me this suggests a sacred relationship between the temple and the home not only can we turn the doors of our homes to the temple or the house of the lord we can make our homes a house of the lord recently in a stake conference all present were invited by the visiting authority elder glen jenson an area seventy to take a virtual tour of their homes using their spiritual eyes i would like to invite each of you to do this also wherever your home may be and whatever its configuration the application of eternal gospel principles within its walls is universal lets begin imagine that you are opening your front door and walking inside your home what do you see and how do you feel is it a place of love peace and refuge from the world as is the temple is it clean and orderly as you walk through the rooms of your home do you see uplifting images which include appropriate pictures of the temple and the savior is your bedroom or sleeping area a place for personal prayer is your gathering area or kitchen a place where food is prepared and enjoyed together allowing uplifting conversation and family time are scriptures found in a room where the family can study pray and learn together can you find your personal gospel study space does the music you hear or the entertainment you see online or otherwise offend the spirit is the conversation uplifting and without contention that concludes our tour perhaps you as i found a few spots that need some home improvementhopefully not an extreme home makeover whether our living space is large or small humble or extravagant there is a place for each of these gospel priorities in each of our homes in order to keep the temple and those who attend it sacred and worthy the lord has established standards through his servants the prophets we may be welladvised to consider together in family council standards for our homes to keep them sacred and to allow them to be a house of the lord the admonition to establish a house of prayer a house of fasting a house of faith a house of learning a house of glory a house of order a house of god9 provides divine insight into the type of home the lord would have us build doing such begins the construction of a spiritual mansion in which we all may reside regardless of our worldly circumstancea home filled with treasure that neither moth nor rust doth corrupt10 there exists a righteous unity between the temple and the home understanding the eternal nature of the temple will
