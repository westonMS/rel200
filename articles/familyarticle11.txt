in partnership with the lord by elder ulisses soares of the quorum of the twelve apostles the restored gospel of jesus christ proclaims the principle of full partnership between woman and man both in mortal life and in the eternities within the first few months of our marriage my dear wife expressed her desire to study music intending to please her i decided to orchestrate a big heartfelt surprise for my sweetheart i went to a musical instrument store and bought her a piano as a gift i excitedly put the purchase receipt in a box with a beautiful bow and gave it to her expecting an effusive reaction of gratitude for her extremely loving and attentive husband when she opened that little box and saw its contents she lovingly looked at me and said oh my dear you are wonderful but let me ask you a question is this a gift or a debt after counseling together about the surprise we decided to cancel the purchase we were living on a student budget as is the case with many young newlyweds this experience helped me recognize the importance of the principle of full partnership in a marital relationship and how its application could help my wife and me to be of one heart and one mind1 the restored gospel of jesus christ proclaims the principle of full partnership between woman and man both in mortal life and in the eternities although each possesses specific attributes and divinely appointed responsibilities woman and man fill equally relevant and essential roles in gods plan of happiness for his children2 this was evident from the very beginning when the lord declared that it was not good that the man should be alone wherefore he would make an help meet for him3 in the lords plan a help meet was a companion who would walk shoulder to shoulder with adam in full partnership4 in fact eve was a heavenly blessing in adams life through her divine nature and spiritual attributes she inspired adam to work in partnership with her to achieve gods plan of happiness for all mankind5 let us consider two fundamental principles that strengthen the partnership between man and woman the first principle is we are all alike unto god6 according to gospel doctrine the difference between woman and man does not override the eternal promises that god has for his sons and daughters one has no greater possibilities for celestial glory than the other in the eternities7 the savior himself invites all of us gods children to come unto him and partake of his goodness and he denieth none that come unto him8 therefore in this context we are all considered equal before him when spouses understand and incorporate this principle they do not position themselves as president or vice president of their family there is no superiority or inferiority in the marriage relationship and neither walks ahead of or behind the other they walk side by side as equals the divine offspring of god they become one in thought desire and purpose with our heavenly father and jesus christ9 leading and guiding the family unit together in an equal partnership love is not possession but participation part of that cocreation which is our human calling10 with true participation husband and wife merge into the synergistic oneness of an everlasting dominion that without compulsory means will flow with spiritual life to them and their posterity forever and ever11 the second relevant principle is the golden rule taught by the savior in the sermon on the mount and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise12 this principle indicates an attitude of mutuality reciprocity unity and interdependence and is based on the second great commandment thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself13 it merges with other christian attributes such as longsuffering gentleness meekness and kindness to better understand the application of this principle we can look at the sacred and eternal bond established by god between our first parents adam and eve they became one flesh14 creating a dimension of unity that allowed them to walk together with respect gratitude and love forgetting about themselves and seeking each others wellbeing on their journey to eternity those same characteristics are what we strive for in a united marriage today through the temple sealing a woman and a man enter the holy order of matrimony in the new and everlasting covenant by way of this order of the priesthood they are given eternal blessings and divine power to direct their family affairs as they live according to the covenants they have made from that point on they move forward interdependently and in full partnership with the lord especially in regard to each of their divinely appointed responsibilities of nurturing and presiding in their family15 nurturing and presiding are interrelated and overlapping responsibilities which means that mothers and fathers are obligated to help one another as equal partners16 and share a balanced leadership in their home to nurture means to nourish teach and support family members which is done by helping them to learn gospel truths and develop faith in heavenly father and jesus christ in an environment of love to preside means to help lead family members back to dwell in gods presence this is done by serving and teaching with gentleness meekness and pure love it also includes leading family members in regular prayer gospel study and other aspects of worship parents work in unity following the example of jesus christ to fulfill these two great responsibilities17 it is important to observe that the government in the family follows the patriarchal pattern differing in some respects from priesthood leadership in the church18 the patriarchal pattern entails that wives and husbands are accountable directly to god for the fulfillment of their sacred responsibilities in the family it calls for a full partnershipa willing compliance with every principle of righteousness and accountabilityand provides opportunities for development within an environment of love and mutual helpfulness19 these special responsibilities do not imply hierarchy and absolutely exclude any kind of abuse or improper use of authority the experience of adam and eve after they left the garden of eden beautifully illustrates the concept of interdependence between a mother and father in nurturing and presiding over their family as taught in the book of moses they worked together to till the earth by the sweat of their brow in order to provide for the physical wellbeing of their family20 they brought children into the world21 they called on the name of the lord together and heard his voice from the way toward the garden of eden22 they accepted the commandments the lord gave them and strove together to obey them23 they then made these things known unto their sons and their daughters24 and ceased not to call upon god together according to their needs25 my dear brothers and sisters nurturing and presiding are opportunities not exclusive limitations one person may have a responsibility for something but may not be the only person doing it when loving parents well understand these two major responsibilities they will strive together to protect and care for the physical and emotional wellbeing of their children they also help them face the spiritual dangers of our day by nurturing them with the good word of the lord as revealed to his prophets although husband and wife support each other in their divinely appointed responsibilities disability death or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation26 sometimes one spouse or the other will have the responsibility of acting in both roles simultaneously whether temporarily or permanently i recently met a sister and a brother who each live in this condition as single parents each of them within their family sphere and in partnership with the lord has decided to devote their lives to the spiritual and temporal care of their children they have not lost sight of their temple covenants made with the lord and his eternal promises despite their divorces both have sought the lords help in all things as they continually strive to endure their challenges and walk in the covenant path they trust that the lord will take care of their needs not only in this life but throughout eternity both have nurtured their children by teaching them with gentleness meekness and pure love even while experiencing difficult circumstances in life from what i know these two single parents do not blame god for their misfortunes instead they look forward with a perfect brightness of hope and confidence to the blessings the lord has in store for them27 brothers and sisters the savior set the perfect example of unity and harmony of purpose and doctrine with our father in heaven he prayed in behalf of his disciples saying that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that they may be one even as we are one28 i testify to you that as wewomen and menwork together in a true and equal partnership we will enjoy the unity taught by the savior as we fulfill the divine responsibilities in our marriage relationships i promise you in the name of christ that hearts will be knit together in unity and in love one towards another29 we will find more joy in our journey to eternal life and our capacity to serve one another and with one another will multiply significantly30 i bear witness to these truths in the holy name of the savior jesus christ amen notes see moses 718 see the family a proclamation
