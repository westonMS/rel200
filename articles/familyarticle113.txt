apostles and prophets with whom i have had the blessed opportunity to serve i testify that president thomas s monson is the lords prophet on the earth today i delight that he is truly a christlike minister to the one reaching out in warmth and love to each individual i delight in priesthood keys and temples that dot the earth making available to each of us eternal ordinances and covenants some of my most celestial days recently have been my own childrens temple marriages with my father performing that holy ordinance i delight in the strength of youth as i see them throng the temples to do baptisms for the dead i love their worthy adherence to the standards leading to the temple and their preparation to be faithful missionaries and righteous mothers and fathers i delight that i am a daughter of heavenly father who loves me i learned of my divine identity in my earliest years at my mothers side just recently i saw my then threeyearold granddaughter learning her identity from her mother eliza had gone to bed distraught she could be comforted only as her mother again told elizas favorite true story about the special night when heavenly father distinctly and clearly whispered to her mommys heart that eliza was a special spirit with a noble mission ahead i take great delight in my role as a nurturer which allows me to express my deepest identity as a woman i never fail to be struck by the way that women young women and even little girls seem to have an instinctive interest and ability in nurturing it is not only a mothers primary responsibility but also part of our individual premortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose the family a proclamation to the world liahona oct 2004 49 ensign nov 1995 102 to nurture is to teach to foster development to promote growth to feed and to nourish who would not shout for joy at being given such a blessed role the scriptures use the word nurture only twice and in both cases speak of the responsibility of parents to raise their children in the nurture and admonition of the lord ephesians 64 enos 11 president hinckley also admonished both men and women to be nurturers he said how much more beautiful would be the society in which we live if every father and mother regarded their children as gifts from the god of heaven and brought them up with true affection in the wisdom and admonition of the lord these our little ones liahona dec 2007 7 ensign dec 2007 9 i delight in families recently i delighted in the birth of a new grandchild into a family that understands that parents have the solemn responsibility to rear their children in love and righteousness the older siblings had a natural curiosity about their little sisters entrance into this world their first lessons about this holy subject were taught by loving parents in a sacred family setting in the celestial climate that accompanies a new souls birth into mortality and in the context of our fathers great eternal plan by contrast the next day upon returning home from kindergarten our granddaughter reported that she had learned that day in class a big new term called sexual abuse i felt concerned that at this early age children already have to be aware for safety reasons of the negative facets of the subject they had so beautifully talked of the night before i delighted as never before in a nurturing family founded upon the teachings of jesus christ jacob taught that the lord delights in the chastity of women jacob 228 i delight in the chastity and purity of all women and men how it must grieve the lord to see virtue violated and modesty mocked on every side in this wicked world the lord has provided for his children great joy through intimate loving relationships as my grandchildren were learning i delight in the clarity of the proclamation to the world on the family which warns that individuals who violate covenants of chastity who abuse spouse or offspring or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before god i delight in the examples of those in the scriptures who walk by faith on their earthly journey each time i walk with abraham and isaac on the road to mount moriah i weep knowing that abraham does not know that there will be an angel and a ram in the thicket at the end of the journey we are each in the middle of our earthly path and we dont know the rest of our own stories but we as abraham are blessed with miracles i delight in the lords mercies and miracles see bless our fast we pray hymns no 138 i know that his tender mercies and his miracles large and small are real they come in his way and on his timetable sometimes it is not until we have reached our extremity jesuss disciples on the sea of galilee had to toil in rowing against a contrary wind all through the night before jesus finally came to their aid he did not come until the fourth watch meaning near dawn yet he did come see mark 64551 my testimony is that miracles do come though sometimes not until the fourth watch right now i am exerting my faith and prayers and watching for miracles in behalf of loved ones who are physically sick emotionally bereft and spiritually astray i delight in the lords love for each of his children and in his wisdom to allow us individually tailored earthly experiences finally i delight in more than i can express the eternal love and constant help of my
