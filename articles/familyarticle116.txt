daughters of god by elder m russell ballard of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder m russell ballard there is no role in life more essential and more eternal than that of motherhood brothers and sisters recently my wife barbara had back surgery and could not lift twist or bend consequently i have done more lifting twisting and bending than ever beforeand it has made me more appreciative of what women and especially you mothers do every day in our homes while women live in homes under many different circumstancesmarried single widowed or divorced some with children and some withoutall are beloved of god and he has a plan for his righteous daughters to receive the highest blessings of eternity this afternoon i want to focus my remarks primarily on mothers particularly on young mothers as a young father i learned the demanding role of motherhood i served as a counselor and then as bishop for a period of 10 years during that time we were blessed with six of our seven children barbara was often wornout by the time i got home sunday evening she tried to explain what it was like to sit on the back row in sacrament meeting with our young family then the day came that i was released after sitting on the stand for 10 years i was now sitting with my family on the back row the wards singing mothers chorus was providing the music and i found myself sitting alone with our six children i have never been so busy in my whole life i had the hand puppets going on both hands and that wasnt working too well the cheerios got away from me and that was embarrassing the coloring books didnt seem to entertain as well as they should as i struggled with the children through the meeting i looked up at barbara and she was watching me and smiling i learned for myself to more fully appreciate what all of you dear mothers do so well and so faithfully a generation later as a grandfather i have watched the sacrifices my daughters have made in rearing their children and now still another generation later i am watching with awe the pressures on my granddaughters as they guide their children in this busy and demanding world after observing and empathizing with three generations of mothers and thinking of my own dear mother i surely know that there is no role in life more essential and more eternal than that of motherhood there is no one perfect way to be a good mother each situation is unique each mother has different challenges different skills and abilities and certainly different children the choice is different and unique for each mother and each family many are able to be fulltime moms at least during the most formative years of their childrens lives and many others would like to be some may have to work partor fulltime some may work at home some may divide their lives into periods of home and family and work what matters is that a mother loves her children deeply and in keeping with the devotion she has for god and her husband prioritizes them above all else i am impressed by countless mothers who have learned how important it is to focus on the things that can only be done in a particular season of life if a child lives with parents for 18 or 19 years that span is only onefourth of a parents life and the most formative time of all the early years in a childs life represents less than onetenth of a parents normal life it is crucial to focus on our children for the short time we have them with us and to seek with the help of the lord to teach them all we can before they leave our homes this eternally important work falls to mothers and fathers as equal partners i am grateful that today many fathers are more involved in the lives of their children but i believe that the instincts and the intense nurturing involvement of mothers with their children will always be a major key to their wellbeing in the words of the proclamation on the family mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children the family a proclamation to the world liahona oct 2004 49 ensign nov 1995 102 we need to remember that the full commitment of motherhood and of putting children first can be difficult through my own fourgeneration experience in our family and through discussions with mothers of young children throughout the church i know something of a mothers emotions that accompany her commitment to be at home with young children there are moments of great joy and incredible fulfillment but there are also moments of a sense of inadequacy monotony and frustration mothers may feel they receive little or no appreciation for the choice they have made sometimes even husbands seem to have no idea of the demands upon their wives as a church we have enormous respect and gratitude to you mothers of young children we want you to be happy and successful in your families and to have the validation and support you need and deserve so today let me ask and briefly answer four questions while my answers may seem extremely simple if the simple things are being tended to a mothers life can be most rewarding the first question what can you do as a young mother to reduce the pressure and enjoy your family more first recognize that the joy of motherhood comes in moments there will be hard times and frustrating times but amid the challenges there are shining moments of joy and satisfaction author anna quindlen reminds us not to rush past the fleeting moments she said the biggest mistake i made as a parent is the one that most of us make i did not live in the moment enough this is particularly clear now that the moment is gone captured only in photographs there is one picture of my three children sitting in the grass on a quilt in the shadow of the swing set on a summer day ages six four and one and i wish i could remember what we ate and what we talked about and how they sounded and how they looked when they slept that night i wish i had not been in such a hurry to get on to the next thing dinner bath book bed i wish i had treasured the doing a little more and the getting it done a little less loud and clear 2004 1011 second dont overschedule yourselves or your children we live in a world that is filled with options if we are not careful we will find every minute jammed with social events classes exercise time book clubs scrapbooking church callings music sports the internet and our favorite tv shows one mother told me of a time that her children had 29 scheduled commitments every week music lessons scouts dance little league day camps soccer art and so forth she felt like a taxi driver finally she called a family meeting and announced something has to go we have no time to ourselves and no time for each other families need unstructured time when relationships can deepen and real parenting can take place take time to listen to laugh and to play together third even as you try to cut out the extra commitments sisters find some time for yourself to cultivate your gifts and interests pick one or two things that you would like to learn or do that will enrich your life and make time for them water cannot be drawn from an empty well and if you are not setting aside a little time for what replenishes you you will have less and less to give to others even to your children avoid any kind of substance abuse mistakenly thinking that it will help you accomplish more and dont allow yourself to be caught up in the timewasting mindnumbing things like television soap operas or surfing the internet turn to the lord in faith and you will know what to do and how to do it fourth pray study and teach the gospel pray deeply about your children and about your role as a mother parents can offer a unique and wonderful kind of prayer because they are praying to the eternal parent of us all there is great power in a prayer that essentially says we are stewardparents over thy children father please help us to raise them as thou wouldst want them raised the second question what more can a husband do to support his wife the mother of their children first show extra appreciation and give more validation for what your wife does every day notice things and say thank youoften schedule some evenings together just the two of you second have a regular time to talk with your wife about each childs needs and what you can do to help third give your wife a day away now and then just take over the household and give your wife a break from her daily responsibilities taking over for a while will greatly enhance your appreciation of what your wife does you may do a lot of lifting twisting and bending fourth come home from work and take an active role with your family dont put work friends or sports ahead of listening to playing with and teaching your children the third question what can children even young children do now you children please listen to me because there are some simple things you can do to help your mother you can pick up your toys when you are finished playing with them and when you get a little older you can make your bed help with the dishes and do other choreswithout being asked you can say thank you more often when you finish a nice meal when a story is read to you at bedtime or when clean clothes are put in your drawers most of all you can put your arms around your mother often and tell her you love her the last question what can the church do there are many things the church offers to mothers and families but for my purpose today may i suggest that the bishopric and the ward council members be especially watchful and considerate of the time and resource demands on young mothers and their families know them and be wise in what you ask them to do at this time in their lives almas counsel to his son helaman applies to us today behold i say unto you that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass alma 376 i hope all of you dear sisters married or single never wonder if you have worth in the sight of the lord and to the leaders of the church we love you we respect you and appreciate your influence in preserving the family and assisting with the growth and the spiritual vitality of the church let us remember that the family is central to the creators plan for the eternal destiny of his children the family a proclamation to the world the scriptures and the teachings of the prophets and apostles help all family members to prepare together now to be together through all eternity i pray that god will continually bless the women of the church to find joy and happiness in their sacred roles as daughters of god now in closing i want to add my witness of president monsons prophetic call i have known him since he was 22 and i was 21 thats 58 years i have watched the hand of the lord prepare him for this day to preside over the church as the prophet and president and i add my testimony along with all of the other testimonies that have been borne through this conference of his special calling as president of the church and add my testimony along with all of the others that jesus is the christ and this is his church we are doing his work to which i testify in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
