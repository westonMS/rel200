the power of godliness is manifested in the temples of god by elder octaviano tenorio of the seventy imageelder octaviano tenorio the power of godliness is manifested to all people who make sacred covenants with our heavenly father my dear brothers and sisters one of the things which i am most grateful to my heavenly father for is the opportunity i had to work for 15 years as recorder in the mexico city mexico temple in this sacred place as in all temples ordinances are performed for the living and the dead by the power of the priesthood in 1832 the prophet joseph smith received a revelation about the priesthood and this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom even the key of the knowledge of god therefore in the ordinances thereof the power of godliness is manifest dc 841920 i have had wonderful experiences within the walls of the temple that verify this in 1993 after i had served as president of the mexico tuxtla guti√©rrez mission we traveled as a family to see my parents who lived in northern mexico during the trip we talked about the joy of serving the lord and seeing the change in people who had accepted the gospel during the three years we were in the mission we were commenting about those people who were baptized confirmed and had received the priesthood and the ones we knew had entered the temple and were sealed as families for eternity my youngest son asked a question that made me reflect dad are you sealed to your parents i told him that because my father had been less active for many years he and my mother were not sealed in the temple to help him become active i thought up a plan it involved my children and i explained to them how we would do it every sunday my father would get up early to take my mother and sister to church only to return home wait for the services to end then go back to pick them up so i assigned my children to go with him and say grandpa would you do us a favor i knew his answer would be whatever you want my children then they would ask him if he would go with them to church and stay with them so he could listen to their testimonies it was the first sunday of the month i also knew my father would give any excuse not to go so i planned to enter the room to help my children convince him the time soon came for executing the plan my daughter susana approached my father and asked him about the favor sure enough my father told her he would do anything he could for them then came the invitation to go to church and just as we had predicted he used this excuse i cant because i havent even showered thats when my wife and i who were hiding behind the door shouted well wait for you when we realized he was not making a decision my wife and i entered the room and together with our children began to insist shower shower then what we expected happened my father came with us he stayed for the services listened to the testimonies of my children his heart was softened and from that sunday on he never missed church months later at the age of 78 he and my mother were sealed and we his children were sealed to them i know that thanks to the power of godliness manifest in the ordinances of the temple i can now be reunited with my parents for all eternity even after death many times we dont comprehend the meaning of the ordinances of the temple in their fulness until after we have known affliction or passed through experiences that could have been extremely sad without the knowledge of the plan of salvation when my wife and i had only been married a year and a half she was ready to deliver our first baby we had decided that she would have the baby in the chihuahua colonies where she had been born at that time i was working in mexico city and we decided that she would be there a month ahead of the delivery date i was planning to join her later the delivery date arrived i was at work when i received a call from my fatherinlaw the news was good octaviano your wife has given birth and you now have a little daughter who is beautiful so in my happiness i began to announce this to my friends and partners at work who in turn asked me for chocolates to celebrate the birth of my little one the next day i began to give out chocolates throughout the four floors of our office building when i reached the second floor i received another call from my fatherinlaw this time the news was different octaviano your wife is fine but your daughter has passed away the funeral will be today and you dont have time to come what are you going to do i asked to speak with rosa my wife and then asked her if she was ok she replied that she was fine depending on how i was feeling then we talked about the plan of salvation remembering this scripture and i also beheld that all children who die before they arrive at the years of accountability are saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven dc 13710 i asked her do you believe that and she said yes i do then i replied we should be happy then i love you and if you are ok with that ill take my vacation in two weeks spend some time with you and return back together to mexico we knew that one day we would be reunited with our daughter because we were sealed by the power of the priesthood in the temple we ended the telephone call and i resumed giving out the chocolates in my office building seeing me do this one of my coworkers was surprised and asked me how i could do this after such terrible news i answered if you have three hours i can explain to you why i am not feeling too sad and about my knowledge of what happens after death he didnt have three hours at that moment but did later we ended up talking for four hours he accepted the gospel and together with his mother and brother was baptized into the church after receiving the discussions i know that thanks to the power of godliness manifested in the ordinances of the temple i will now be able to know my daughter i will embrace her and we will be with her for eternity just as we are now with our three surviving children i rejoice in the words of malachi behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse malachi 456 this priesthood makes eternal families possible it allows me a son to turn my heart to my father who passed away last year and to be calm in my hope through the savior that i will see him again this priesthood allows me as a father to turn my heart to our two children who died as infants and to be calm in my hope through the savior that i will know them and they will know i was their earthly father as i look into their eyes and tell them i love them it is this priesthood which has allowed me to see in the holiness of the temple how the power of godliness is manifested to all people whoafter exercising faith in christ repenting of their sins and searching fervently for happinesscome to make sacred covenants with our heavenly father and receive his holy ordinances that bind on earth as well as bind in heaven i love temple work i know that god lives that jesus christ is my savior and that president gordon b hinckley is a true prophet in the name of jesus christ amen
