divine love in the fathers plan by president dallin h oaks first counselor in the first presidency the purpose of the doctrine and policies of this restored church is to prepare gods children for salvation in the celestial kingdom and for exaltation in its highest degree the gospel plan shows our heavenly fathers love for all his children to understand this we must seek to understand his plan and his commandments he loves his children so much that he gave his only begotten son jesus christ to be our savior and redeemer to suffer and die for us in the restored church of jesus christ of latterday saints we have a unique understanding of our heavenly fathers plan this gives us a different way of viewing the purpose of mortal life the divine judgment that follows it and the ultimate glorious destiny of all of gods children i love you my brothers and sisters i love all of gods children when jesus was asked which is the great commandment in the law he taught that to love god and to love our neighbors are the first of gods great commandments1 those commands are first because they invite us to grow spiritually by seeking to imitate gods love for us i wish we all had a better understanding of the loving doctrine and policies that our heavenly father and his son jesus christ have established in the church of jesus christ of latterday saints what i say here seeks to clarify how gods love explains that doctrine and the churchs inspired policies i a common misunderstanding of the judgment that ultimately follows mortal life is that good people go to a place called heaven and bad people go to an everlasting place called hell this erroneous assumption of only two ultimate destinations implies that those who cannot keep all the commandments required for heaven will necessarily be forever destined for hell a loving heavenly father has a better plan for his children the revealed doctrine of the restored church of jesus christ teaches that all the children of godwith exceptions too limited to consider herewill finally wind up in a kingdom of glory2 in my fathers house are many mansions3 jesus taught from modern revelation we know that those mansions are in three different kingdoms of glory in the final judgment each of us will be judged according to our deeds and the desires of our hearts4 before that we will need to suffer for our unrepented sins the scriptures are clear on that5 then our righteous judge will grant us residence in one of those kingdoms of glory thus as we know from modern revelation all shall be judged and every man shall receive according to his own works his own dominion in the mansions which are prepared6 the lord has chosen to reveal comparatively little about two of these kingdoms of glory in contrast the lord has revealed much about the highest kingdom of glory which the bible describes as the glory of the sun7 in the celestial glory8 there are three degrees or levels9 the highest of these is exaltation in the celestial kingdom wherein we may become like our father and his son jesus christ to help us develop the godly attributes and the change in nature necessary to realize our divine potential the lord has revealed doctrine and established commandments based on eternal law this is what we teach in the church of jesus christ of latterday saints because the purpose of the doctrine and policies of this restored church is to prepare gods children for salvation in the celestial glory and more particularly for exaltation in its highest degree the covenants made and the blessings promised to the faithful in the temples of god are the key this explains our worldwide building of temples about which the choir has sung so beautifully some are puzzled at this emphasis not understanding that the covenants and ordinances of the temple guide us toward achieving exaltation this can be understood only in the context of the revealed truth of three degrees of glory because of our heavenly fathers great love for all of his children he has provided other kingdoms of gloryas elder quentin l cook explained yesterdayall of which are more wonderful than we can comprehend10 the atonement of jesus christ makes all of this possible he has revealed that he glorifies the father and saves all the works of his hands11 that salvation is granted in different kingdoms of glory we know from modern revelation that all kingdoms have a law given12 significantly he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory and he who cannot abide the law of a terrestrial kingdom cannot abide a terrestrial glory and he who cannot abide the law of a telestial kingdom cannot abide a telestial glory13 in other words the kingdom of glory we receive in the final judgment is determined by the laws we choose to abide by in our heavenly fathers loving plan under that plan there are multiple kingdoms so that all of his children can be assigned to a kingdom where they can abide ii the teachings and policies of the lords restored church apply these eternal truths in a way that can be fully understood only in the context of our heavenly fathers loving plan for all of his children thus we honor individual agency most are aware of this churchs great efforts to promote religious freedom these efforts are in furtherance of our heavenly fathers plan we seek to help all of his childrennot just our own membersenjoy the precious freedom to choose similarly we are sometimes asked why we send missionaries to so many nations even among christian populations we are also asked why we give enormous humanitarian aid to persons who are not members of our church without linking this to our missionary efforts we do this because the lord has taught us to esteem all of his children as our brothers and sisters and we want to share our spiritual and temporal abundance with everyone eternal doctrine also provides a distinctive perspective on children through this perspective we see the bearing and nurturing of children as part of the divine plan it is a joyful and sacred duty of those given the power to participate in it therefore we are commanded to teach and contend for principles and practices that provide the best conditions for the development and happiness of children under gods plan iii finally the church of jesus christ of latterday saints is properly known as a familycentered church but not well understood is the reality that our familycenteredness is not limited to mortal relationships eternal relationships are also fundamental to our theology the mission of the restored church is to help all the children of god qualify for what god desires as their ultimate destiny by the redemption provided through the atonement of christ all may attain eternal life exaltation in the celestial kingdom which mother eve declared god giveth unto all the obedient14 this is more than salvation president russell m nelson has reminded us that in gods eternal plan salvation is an individual matter but exaltation is a family matter15 fundamental to us is gods revelation that exaltation can be attained only through faithfulness to the covenants of an eternal marriage between a man and a woman16 that divine doctrine is why we teach that gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose17 that is also why the lord has required his restored church to oppose social and legal pressures to retreat from his doctrine of marriage between a man and a woman to oppose changes that homogenize the differences between men and women or confuse or alter gender the restored churchs positions on these fundamentals frequently provoke opposition we understand that our heavenly fathers plan allows for opposition in all things18 and satans most strenuous opposition is directed at whatever is most important to that plan consequently he seeks to oppose progress toward exaltation by distorting marriage discouraging childbearing or confusing gender however we know that in the long run the divine purpose and plan of our loving heavenly father will not be changed personal circumstances may change and gods plan assures that in the long run the faithful who keep their covenants will have the opportunity to qualify for every promised blessing19 a uniquely valuable teaching to help us prepare for eternal life the greatest of all the gifts of god20 is the 1995 proclamation on the family21 its declarations are of course different from some current laws practices and advocacy such as cohabitation and samesex marriage those who do not fully understand the fathers loving plan for his children may consider this family proclamation no more than a changeable statement of policy in contrast we affirm that the family proclamation founded on irrevocable doctrine defines the kind of family relationships where the most important part of our eternal development can occur that is the context for the unique doctrine and policies of the restored church of jesus christ of latterday saints iv in many relationships and circumstances in mortal life each of us must live with differences as followers of christ who should love our fellow men we should live peacefully with those who do not believe as we do we are all children of a loving heavenly father for all of us he has destined life after death and ultimately a kingdom of glory god desires all of us to strive for his highest possible blessings by keeping his highest commandments covenants and ordinances all of which culminate in his holy temples being built throughout the world we must seek to share these truths of eternity with others but with the love we owe to all of our neighbors we always accept their decisions as a book of mormon prophet taught we must press forward having a love of god and of all men22 as president russell m nelson declared in our last conference there has never been a time in the history of the world when knowledge of our savior is more personally vital and relevant to every human soul the pure doctrine of christ is powerful it changes the life of everyone who understands it and seeks to implement it in his or her life23 may we all implement that sacred doctrine in our own lives i pray in the name of jesus christ amen notes see matthew 223640 see doctrine and covenants 764043 john 142 see
