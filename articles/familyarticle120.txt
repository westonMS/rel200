sister your mom or dad let me tell you an experience from my own life and how my brothers patterns of righteousness and example resulted in our family being blessed eternally my brother and i were born of goodly parents 1 nephi 11 who loved and made great sacrifices for the two of us but our family had not been blessed with the sacred ordinances of the temple many years ago on a day in late december we received a letter from my brother who was serving in the california north mission the outside of the envelope cautioned do not open until you are all together as my father mother and i gathered to open his sevenpage typewritten letter we read his testimony of prayer he taught us the doctrine of eternal families from the scriptures we read his experiences of how fasting and prayer helped his investigators prepare to receive the ordinance of baptism he assured us that our family too could be blessed through fasting and prayer then came his challenge the bishop of the stanford ward spoke on a topic a couple of months ago which really hit home the bishops talk made me stop and realize the goals i want to accomplish in life uppermost in my mind is the goal i want to achieve with my own family that of course being sealed to you mom and dad for time and all eternity in the house of the lord i love you very much and want our family to be together in the eternities then his closing words may the lord guide you in this important decision and may you pray together as a family is my prayer as a teenager i too had prayed for this blessing to come to my family this letter now brought hope for my righteous desire the new year was an opportunity for our family to make some changes in the many months that followed we established family patterns of righteousness we prayed together studied about the ordinances of the temple paid tithing and attended our meetings regularlyas a family shortly after my brother returned from his mission we were prepared to receive the ordinances of the temple i knew the lord had heard and answered our prayers as we surrounded the holy altar in the temple and were sealed as a family for time and all eternity can you make a difference in your family yes you can i often wonder about my familys eternal progression if my brother had not written that powerful letter his patterns of righteousness and example changed our lives
