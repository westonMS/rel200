mothers who know by julie b beck relief society general president imagejulie b beck there is eternal influence and power in motherhood in the book of mormon we read about 2000 exemplary young men who were exceedingly valiant courageous and strong yea they were men of truth and soberness for they had been taught to keep the commandments of god and to walk uprightly before him alma 5321 these faithful young men paid tribute to their mothers they said our mothers knew it alma 5648 i would suspect that the mothers of captain moroni mosiah mormon and other great leaders also knew the responsibility mothers have today has never required more vigilance more than at any time in the history of the world we need mothers who know children are being born into a world where they wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places ephesians 6121 however mothers need not fear when mothers know who they are and who god is and have made covenants with him they will have great power and influence for good on their children mothers who know bear children mothers who know desire to bear children whereas in many cultures in the world children are becoming less valued2 in the culture of the gospel we still believe in having children prophets seers and revelators who were sustained at this conference have declared that gods commandment for his children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force3 president ezra taft benson taught that young couples should not postpone having children and that in the eternal perspective childrennot possessions not position not prestigeare our greatest jewels4 faithful daughters of god desire children in the scriptures we read of eve see moses 426 sarah see genesis 1716 rebekah see genesis 2460 and mary see 1 nephi 111320 who were foreordained to be mothers before children were born to them some women are not given the responsibility of bearing children in mortality but just as hannah of the old testament prayed fervently for her child see 1 samuel 111 the value women place on motherhood in this life and the attributes of motherhood they attain here will rise with them in the resurrection see dc 13018 women who desire and work toward that blessing in this life are promised they will receive it for all eternity and eternity is much much longer than mortality there is eternal influence and power in motherhood mothers who know honor sacred ordinances and covenants mothers who know honor sacred ordinances and covenants i have visited sacrament meetings in some of the poorest places on the earth where mothers have dressed with great care in their sunday best despite walking for miles on dusty streets and using wornout public transportation they bring daughters in clean and ironed dresses with hair brushed to perfection their sons wear white shirts and ties and have missionary haircuts these mothers know they are going to sacrament meeting where covenants are renewed these mothers have made and honor temple covenants they know that if they are not pointing their children to the temple they are not pointing them toward desired eternal goals these mothers have influence and power mothers who know are nurturers mothers who know are nurturers this is their special assignment and role under the plan of happiness5 to nurture means to cultivate care for and make grow therefore mothers who know create a climate for spiritual and temporal growth in their homes another word for nurturing is homemaking homemaking includes cooking washing clothes and dishes and keeping an orderly home home is where women have the most power and influence therefore latterday saint women should be the best homemakers in the world working beside children in homemaking tasks creates opportunities to teach and model qualities children should emulate nurturing mothers are knowledgeable but all the education women attain will avail them nothing if they do not have the skill to make a home that creates a climate for spiritual growth growth happens best in a house of order and women should pattern their homes after the lords house see dc 109 nurturing requires organization patience love and work helping growth occur through nurturing is truly a powerful and influential role bestowed on women mothers who know are leaders mothers who know are leaders in equal partnership with their husbands they lead a great and eternal organization these mothers plan for the future of their organization they plan for missions temple marriages and education they plan for prayer scripture study and family home evening mothers who know build children into future leaders and are the primary examples of what leaders look like they do not abandon their plan by succumbing to social pressure and worldly models of parenting these wise mothers who know are selective about their own activities and involvement to conserve their limited strength in order to maximize their influence where it matters most mothers who know are teachers mothers who know are always teachers since they are not babysitters they are never off duty a welltaught friend told me that he did not learn anything at church that he had not already learned at home his parents used family scripture study prayer family home evening mealtimes and other gatherings to teach think of the power of our future missionary force if mothers considered their homes as a premissionary training center then the doctrines of the gospel taught in the mtc would be a review and not a revelation that is influence that is power mothers who know do less mothers who know do less they permit less of what will not bear good fruit eternally they allow less media in their homes less distraction less activity that draws their children away from their home mothers who know are willing to live on less and consume less of the worlds goods in order to spend more time with their childrenmore time eating together more time working together more time reading together more time talking laughing singing and exemplifying these mothers choose carefully and do not try to choose it all their goal is to prepare a rising generation of children who will take the gospel of jesus christ into the entire world their goal is to prepare future fathers and mothers who will be builders of the lords kingdom for the next 50 years that is influence that is power mothers who know stand strong and immovable who will prepare this righteous generation of sons and daughters latterday saint women will do thiswomen who know and love the lord and bear testimony of him women who are strong and immovable and who do not give up during difficult and discouraging times we are led by an inspired prophet of god who has called upon the women of the church to stand strong and immovable for that which is correct and proper under the plan of the lord6 he has asked us to begin in our own homes7 to teach children the ways of truth latterday saint women should be the very best in the world at upholding nurturing and protecting families i have every confidence that our women will do this and will come to be known as mothers who knew alma 5648 in the name of jesus christ amen notes see gordon b hinckley standing strong and immovable
