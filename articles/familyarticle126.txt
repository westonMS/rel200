dont leave for tomorrow what you can do today by elder claudio r m costa of the presidency of the seventy imageelder claudio r m costa now is the time to perform our godgiven duties concerning the family on september 23 1995 the first presidency and the quorum of the twelve apostles introduced to the church and the world a document called the family a proclamation to the world i quote from the paragraph which reads husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children1 we live in a day and age in which this counsel is indeed very important many parents argue they dont have time for their families the fastpaced lifestyle of modernday life and excessive amounts of work are curbing parents attention from what is most important to give time to give of oneself to ones family the lord taught us that every man has the responsibility to provide for his family2 but that does not mean solely to store up the house with food and other items which are needed or desired we must also have time to provide our family with teachings what should we teach our father has taught us that parents are obligated to teach the gospel to their children3 the prophet lehi understood well his responsibility to teach his children nephi declared that he had been taught in all the learning of his father4 the lord instructed us how to take care of our families when he told us through his prophets in the proclamation to the world parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness to provide for their physical and spiritual needs to teach them to love and serve one another to observe the commandments of god and to be lawabiding citizens wherever they live5 we know god has taught us for centuries how to protect and take care of our families we also know and can see that the adversary has been attacking the family now is the time to use all those teachings now is the time to perform our godgiven duties concerning the family president james e faust gave us three key things we can do to protect and strengthen our families family prayer parents must teach their children that they are gods children and therefore need to pray to him daily family home evening as president faust taught us family home evening is for all of us no matter what stage of life we are in we must have monday nights free of all other activities that might keep us from gathering as a family personal and family scripture study we need to help our children strengthen their faith and testimony through this basic habit6 as we follow president fausts wise counsel we will be protecting family members against satans attacks as well as strengthening their faith and testimony in the lord jesus christ in the family proclamation we also learn that by divine design fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children in these sacred responsibilities fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners7 it is in the home that the family learns and applies gospel principles great love is necessary in order to teach and guide a family loving fathers and mothers will teach their children to worship god in their home when a worshipping spirit permeates the home that spirit is extended into the life of each family member this will prepare them to make whatever sacrifice is necessary to be able to return to gods presence and stay together as a family for all eternity the family proclamation helps us understand much of the love the savior referred to when he told us we must love one another8 he gave us the supreme example of love when he declared greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends9 he later atoned for all our sins and finally gave his life for all of us we can lay down our lives for those we love not by physically dying for them but rather by living for themgiving of our time always being present in their lives serving them being courteous affectionate and showing true love for those of our family and to all menas the savior taught we dont know what could happen to us tomorrow and that is why today is the time to start showing your love through small acts such as a hug and an i love you to your spouse and children and those around you i recently read a text which expresses the urgency of not leaving for tomorrow what you can do today in july of this year brazil witnessed the most devastating aircraft accident in its history there were 199 people killed including passengers airline workers crew members and others who were at the site when the accident happened the text i mentioned was said to have been posted on the airline communication board by the husband of one of the flight attendants who died in the accident it is entitled tomorrow never comes and is based upon a poem by norma cornett marek if i knew this would be the last time i would watch you sleep i would hug you tighter i would plead with the lord to protect you if i knew this would be the last time i saw you walk out the door i would hug and kiss you and call you back to hug and kiss you one more time if i knew this would be the last time i would hear your voice in prayer i would record every gesture every look every smile every one of your words so that i could listen to it later day after day if i knew this would be the last time i would spend an extra minute or two to tell you i love you instead of assuming you already knew it if i knew this would be our last time our last moment i would be by your side spending the day with you instead of thinking well im sure other opportunities will come so i can let this day go by of course there will be a day to revise things and we would have a second chance to do things right oh of course there will be another day for us to say i love you and certainly there will be another chance to tell each other can i help with anything but in my case there isnt one i dont have you here with me and today is the last day we haveour farewell therefore i would like to say how much i love you and i hope you never forget it tomorrow is not promised to anyone young or old today might be your last chance to hold tight to the hand of the one you love and show all you feel if you are waiting for tomorrow why not do it today because if tomorrow never comes you certainly will regret for the rest of your life not having spent some extra time for a smile a conversation a hug a kiss because you were too busy to give that person what ended up being their last wish then hug tight today the one you love your friends your family and whisper in their ears how much you love them and want them close to you use your time to say im sorry please forgive me thank you or even that was nothing its all right because if tomorrow never comes you will not have to regret today the past doesnt come back and the future might not come10 let us express our love to our spouse and children and our brothers and sisters today i know god lives i know jesus is the christ our savior and redeemer i know that joseph smith is a prophet of the lord and that gordon b hinckley is gods living prophet on this earth in the name of jesus christ amen notes liahona
