the tongue of angels by elder jeffrey r holland of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder jeffrey r holland our words like our deeds should be filled with faith and hope and charity the prophet joseph smith deepened our understanding of the power of speech when he taught it is by words that every being works when he works by faith god said let there be light and there was light joshua spake and the great lights which god had created stood still elijah commanded and the heavens were stayed for the space of three years and six months so that it did not rain all this was done by faith faith then works by words and with words its mightiest works have been and will be performed1 like all gifts which cometh from above words are sacred and must be spoken with care and by constraint of the spirit2 it is with this realization of the power and sanctity of words that i wish to caution us if caution is needed regarding how we speak to each other and how we speak of ourselves there is a line from the apocrypha which puts the seriousness of this issue better than i can it reads the stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones3 with that stinging image in mind i was particularly impressed to read in the book of james that there was a way i could be a perfect man said james for in many things we offend all but if any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body continuing the imagery of the bridle he writes behold we put bits in the horses mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also ships which though they be great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm then james makes his point the tongue is also a little member but behold how great a forest greek a little fire can burn so is the tongue a fire among our members it defileth the whole body it is set on fire of hell for every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea hath been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison therewith bless we god even the father and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of god out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be4 well that is pretty straightforward obviously james doesnt mean our tongues are always iniquitous nor that everything we say is full of deadly poison but he clearly means that at least some things we say can be destructive even venomousand that is a chilling indictment for a latterday saint the voice that bears profound testimony utters fervent prayer and sings the hymns of zion can be the same voice that berates and criticizes embarrasses and demeans inflicts pain and destroys the spirit of oneself and of others in the process out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing james grieves my brethren and sisters these things ought not so to be is this something we could all work on just a little is this an area in which we could each try to be a little more like a perfect man or woman husbands you have been entrusted with the most sacred gift god can give youa wife a daughter of god the mother of your children who has voluntarily given herself to you for love and joyful companionship think of the kind things you said when you were courting think of the blessings you have given with hands placed lovingly upon her head think of yourself and of her as the god and goddess you both inherently are and then reflect on other moments characterized by cold caustic unbridled words given the damage that can be done with our tongues little wonder the savior said not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man5 a husband who would never dream of striking his wife physically can break if not her bones then certainly her heart by the brutality of thoughtless or unkind speech physical abuse is uniformly and unequivocally condemned in the church of jesus christ of latterday saints if it is possible to be more condemning than that we speak even more vigorously against all forms of sexual abuse today i speak against verbal and emotional abuse of anyone against anyone but especially of husbands against wives brethren these things ought not to be in that same spirit we speak to the sisters as well for the sin of verbal abuse knows no gender wives what of the unbridled tongue in your mouth of the power for good or ill in your words how is it that such a lovely voice which by divine nature is so angelic so close to the veil so instinctively gentle and inherently kind could ever in a turn be so shrill so biting so acrid and untamed a womans words can be more piercing than any dagger ever forged and they can drive the people they love to retreat beyond a barrier more distant than anyone in the beginning of that exchange could ever have imagined sisters there is no place in that magnificent spirit of yours for acerbic or abrasive expression of any kind including gossip or backbiting or catty remarks let it never be said of our home or our ward or our neighborhood that the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity burning among our members may i expand this counsel to make it a full family matter we must be so careful in speaking to a child what we say or dont say how we say it and when is so very very important in shaping a childs view of himself or herself but it is even more important in shaping that childs faith in us and their faith in god be constructive in your comments to a childalways never tell them even in whimsy that they are fat or dumb or lazy or homely you would never do that maliciously but they remember and may struggle for years trying to forgetand to forgive and try not to compare your children even if you think you are skillful at it you may say most positively that susan is pretty and sandra is bright but all susan will remember is that she isnt bright and sandra that she isnt pretty praise each child individually for what that child is and help him or her escape our cultures obsession with comparing competing and never feeling we are enough in all of this i suppose it goes without saying that negative speaking so often flows from negative thinking including negative thinking about ourselves we see our own faults we speakor at least thinkcritically of ourselves and before long that is how we see everyone and everything no sunshine no roses no promise of hope or happiness before long we and everybody around us are miserable i love what elder orson f whitney once said the spirit of the gospel is optimistic it trusts in god and looks on the bright side of things the opposite or pessimistic spirit drags men down and away from god looks on the dark side murmurs complains and is slow to yield obedience6 we should honor the saviors declaration to be of good cheer7 indeed it seems to me we may be more guilty of breaking that commandment than almost any other speak hopefully speak encouragingly including about yourself try not to complain and moan incessantly as someone once said even in the golden age of civilization someone undoubtedly grumbled that everything looked too yellow i have often thought that nephis being bound with cords and beaten by rods must have been more tolerable to him than listening to laman and lemuels constant murmuring8 surely he must have said at least once hit me one more time i can still hear you yes life has its problems and yes there are negative things to face but please accept one of elder hollands maxims for livingno misfortune is so bad that whining about it wont make it worse paul put it candidly but very hopefully he said to all of us let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but only that which is good and edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of god let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christs sake hath forgiven you9 in his deeply moving final testimony nephi calls us to follow the son of god with full purpose of heart promising that after ye have received the baptism of fire and of the holy ghost ye can speak with a new tongue yea even with the tongue of angels and how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the holy ghost angels speak by the power of the holy ghost wherefore they speak the words of christ10 indeed christ was and is the word according to john the beloved11 full of grace and truth full of mercy and compassion so brothers and sisters in this long eternal quest to be more like our savior may we try to be perfect men and women in at least this one way nowby offending not in word or more positively put by speaking with a new tongue the tongue of angels our words like our deeds should be filled with faith and hope and charity the three great christian imperatives so desperately needed in the world today with such words spoken under the influence of the spirit tears can be dried hearts can be healed lives can be elevated hope can return confidence can prevail i pray that my words even on this challenging subject will be encouraging to you not discouraging that you can hear in my voice that i love you because i do more importantly please know that your father in heaven loves you and so does his only begotten son when they speak to youand they willit will not be in the wind nor in the earthquake nor in the fire but it will be with a voice still and small a voice tender and kind12 it will be with the tongue of angels may we all rejoice in the thought that when we say edifying encouraging things unto the least of these our brethren and sisters and little ones we say it unto god13 in the name of jesus christ amen notes lectures on faith 1985
