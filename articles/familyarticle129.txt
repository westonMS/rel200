a lesson from the book of mormon by vicki f matsumori second counselor in the primary general presidency imagevicki f matsumori as firstgeneration members you are the ones who begin the cycle of teaching and strengthening the next generation i love the book of mormon it has wonderful stories for children of all ages but more importantly it teaches timeless lessons which are often retold in primary songs for example a great lesson can be found in the song about the army of helaman we sing we are as the army of helaman we have been taught in our youth1 there are many of us who also feel like we have been born as nephi of old to goodly parents2 my message today is for you firstgeneration members who may have been born to goodly parents and yet were not taught the gospel in your homes instead of being like the army of helaman who had been taught by their mothers that god would deliver them alma 5647 you may be like their parents the people of ammon who grew up as nonbelievers it may be helpful to review the story about the people of ammon they were lamanites who had been taught the gospel by ammon aaron and others see alma 2314 when they accepted the gospel these lamanites were called the antinephilehies and later called the people of ammon see alma 231617 272326 the sons of these people of ammon were the army of helaman who helped fight the nonconverted lamanites see alma 5636 so the strength of the army of helaman really began with their parents who were the people of ammon they were the ones who first learned the gospel from the scriptures they were the ones who learned about the power of prayer and they were the ones who first made and kept covenants with the lord and just as it began with them it begins with you as firstgeneration members you are the ones who begin the cycle of teaching and strengthening the next generation scriptures aaron who was a great missionary used the scriptures to teach the lamanite king and the people of ammon about faith and repentance and about jesus christ and the plan of happiness see alma 221214 2345 today reading and studying the scriptures continues to build our faith helps us resist temptation and allows us to grow closer to heavenly father and his son jesus christ however reading scriptures can present a challenge for everyone president boyd k packer shares his first attempts as a teenager at reading the book of mormon he says i opened it and read i nephi having been born of goodly parents 1 nephi 11 it was interesting and i could follow it until i got over to the isaiah chapters so a few months later i decided to try again to read the book of mormon i read i nephi having been born of goodly parents but every time id hit the barrier of those isaiah chapters finally i decided i was even going to read them3 and of course president packer did read them persistence is the key with every reading of the scriptures unfamiliar words will take on meaning you can read about heroes and great acts of courage you can learn of the tender mercies of the lord and above all you can feel the love of god and know that jesus christ is our savior prayer prayer is another means to build faith when the lamanite king wanted to know what he should do in order to receive the joy of the gospel he prayed to the lord see alma 221617 we too are promised that if we ask it shall be given us stanley was a 19yearold investigator in hong kong he was excited about the gospel and wanted to be baptized until his friends criticized the church he met with the missionaries they testified that god cared enough about him to answer his prayer they invited him to kneel and ask heavenly father if the teachings were true first one companion and then the other offered a short prayer then stanley prayed when he finished his humble prayer they asked him stanley how do you feel he slowly raised his head and in almost a whisper replied baptism baptism4 covenants finally making and keeping covenants also increases faith the people of ammon covenanted that rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives alma 2418 we covenant when we are baptized and take upon us the name of christ we are reminded of those covenants when we partake of the sacrament and when we keep those covenants we can have the constant companionship of the holy ghost it is the holy ghost even the comforter who teaches us all things john 1426 a sister in mexico city was 16 years old when the missionaries came to her door she says that as they taught with the spirit it seemed like they had taken the bandages off my eyes and that the lord was clearing my understanding the word of god and my prayers strengthened me to overcome my next trial to face my father when i met rejection from my family because of my baptism the spirit of the lord strengthened me by whispering keep on go on some of your relatives will become members of the church5 the scriptures prayer and making and keeping covenants have not only helped the people of ammon but also firstgeneration members everywhereincluding me you see while i was born of goodly parents i was not taught the gospel at home however my parents did teach me moral values and ethical conduct i remember my nonmember father helping me write the first talk i gave at church the assigned topic was honesty and instead of quoting the 13th article of faith we used an example of a man whose nickname was honest abe it was left to primary teachers young women leaders and priesthood leaders to provide me with gospel instruction when i was seven years old my junior sunday school teacher taught us about prayer and i wanted to pray she taught us about tithing and i wanted to pay tithing she taught us about fasting and well i was only seven years old so i didnt want to fast but when she taught us about baptism i wanted to be baptized i am grateful for my goodly parents who supported me in my decision and who later also became members of the church it begins with us the people of ammon lived the gospel and they were firm in the faith of christ even unto the end alma 2727 it began with them and it begins with us as firstgeneration members who have gained testimonies we now have a responsibility to teach the children of today we must teach them in our homes and in our classes we must teach them the word of god from the scriptures we must teach them the power of prayer and we must teach them the blessings that come from making and keeping covenants and if we teach them they will be able to say we are as the army of helaman we have been taught in our youth and we will be the lords missionaries to bring the world his truth6 in the name of jesus christ amen notes well bring the world his truth childrens songbook 17273 childrens songbook 17273
