dad journal years ago a car hit and killed his father now to know his father this courageous young man is preserving childhood memories and stories from family and friends when asked where meaning comes in life most people rank family first11 this includes family living and gone before of course when we die we dont cease to exist we continue to live on the other side of the veil still very much alive our ancestors deserve to be remembered12 we remember our heritage through oral histories clan records and family stories memorials or places of remembrance and celebrations with photos foods or items which remind us of loved ones think of where you liveisnt it wonderful how your country and community remember and honor ancestors family others who served and sacrificed for example at the autumn harvest remembrance in south molton devonshire england sister gong and i loved finding the little church and community where generations of our bawden family lived we honor our ancestors by opening the heavens through temple and family history work13 and by becoming a welding link14 in the chain of our generations15 in this age of i choose me societies benefit when generations connect in meaningful ways we need roots to have wingsreal relationships meaningful service life beyond fleeting social media veneers connecting with our ancestors can change our lives in surprising ways from their trials and accomplishments we gain faith and strength16 from their love and sacrifices we learn to forgive and move forward our children become resilient we gain protection and power ties with ancestors increase family closeness gratitude miracles such ties can bring help from the other side of the veil just as joys come in families so can sorrows no individual is perfect nor is any family when those who should love nurture and protect us fail to do so we feel abandoned embarrassed hurt family can become a hollow shell yet with heavens help we can come to understand our family and make peace with each other17 sometimes unwavering commitment to abiding family relationships helps us accomplish hard things in some cases community becomes family a remarkable young woman whose troubled family moved frequently found a loving church family wherever she was to nurture and give her place genetics and family patterns influence but do not determine us god wants our families to be happy and forever forever is too long if we make each other unhappy happy is too short if cherished relationships stop with this life through sacred covenants jesus christ offers his love power and grace to change us18 and heal our relationships selfless temple service for dear ones makes our saviors atonement real for them and us sanctified we can return home to gods presence as families united eternally19 each of our stories is a journey still in progress as we discover create and become with possibilities beyond imagination the prophet joseph smith said it may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk ofa power which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven20 the sociality we create here can exist with eternal glory there21 indeed we without our family members cannot
