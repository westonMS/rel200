a defense and a refuge by president boyd k packer acting president of the quorum of the twelve apostles imagepresident boyd k packer we speak of the church as our refuge our defense there is safety and protection in the church on july 26 1847 their third day in the valley the second having been the sabbath brigham young with members of the twelve and some others climbed a peak about one and a half miles from where i now stand they thought it a good place to raise an ensign to the nations heber c kimball wore a yellow bandana they tied it to willard richardss walking stick and waved it aloft an ensign to the nations brigham young named it ensign peak1 then they descended to their wornout wagons to the few things they had carried 2000 miles and to their travelweary followers it was not what they possessed that gave them strength but what they knew they knew they were apostles of the lord jesus christ they knew that the priesthood had been delivered to them by angelic messengers they knew they had the commandments and the covenants to offer opportunity for the eternal salvation and exaltation for all mankind they were sure that the inspiration of the holy ghost attended them they busied themselves plowing up gardens putting up shelters against the winter soon to come they prepared for others already on the prairie following them to this new gathering place a revelation written nine years earlier directed them to arise and shine forth that thy light may be a standard for the nations and that the gathering together upon the land of zion and upon her stakes may be for a defense and for a refuge from the storm and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth dc 11556 they were to be the light the standard the standard established by revelation is contained in the scriptures through the doctrines of the gospel of jesus christ the principles of the gospel life we follow are based on doctrine and the standards accord with the principles we are bound to the standards by covenant as administered through the ordinances of the gospel by those who have received priesthood and the keys of authority those faithful brethren were not free and we are not free to alter the standards or to ignore them we must live by them it is not a cure or a comfort to simply say they do not matter we all know they do matter for all mankind is instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil 2 nephi 25 if we are doing the best we can we should not become discouraged when we fall short as we do or stumble which we might there is always the remedy of repentance and forgiveness we are to teach our children the moral standard to avoid every kind of immorality the precious powers within their mortal bodies are to be employed only between man and woman lawfully wedded as husband and wife2 we must be completely faithful in marriage we are to keep the law of tithing we attend to our responsibilities in the church we gather each week for sacrament meeting to renew the covenants and earn the promises in those simple and sacred prayers over the bread and water we are to honor the priesthood and be obedient to the covenants and ordinances those brethren on ensign peak knew that they were to live ordinary lives and keep the image of christ engraven in their countenances see alma 514 they understood that the stakes were to be a defense and a refuge but at that time there was not one stake on the earth they knew their mission was to establish stakes of zion in every nation of the earth perhaps they wondered what kind of wrath or storm could be poured out that they had not already experienced they had endured savage opposition violence terrorism their homes had been burned their property taken they were driven from their homes time after time after time they knew then as we know now that there would be no end to opposition the nature of it changes but it never ends there would be no end to the kinds of challenges that the early saints would face new challenges would be different than but certainly not less than that through which they had made their way now the stakes of zion number in the thousands and are all over the world the members number in the millions and growing neither of these can be held back for this is the work of the lord now members live in 160 nations and speak over 200 languages some live with an unspoken fear of what awaits us and the church in the world it grows ever darker in morality and spirituality if we will gather into the church live the simple principles of the gospel live moral lives keep the word of wisdom tend to our priesthood and other duties then we need not live in fear the word of wisdom is a key to both physical health and revelation avoid tea coffee liquor tobacco and narcotics we can live where we wish doing the best we can to make a living whether modest or generous we are free to do as we wish with our lives assured of the approval and even the intervention of the almighty confident of constant spiritual guidance each stake is a defense and a refuge and a standard a stake is selfcontained with all that is needed for the salvation and exaltation of those who would come within its influence and temples are ever closer there has been no end to opposition there are misinterpretations and misrepresentations of us and of our history some of it meanspirited and certainly contrary to the teachings of jesus christ and his gospel sometimes clergy even ministerial organizations oppose us they do what we would never do we do not attack or criticize or oppose others as they do us even today there are those preposterous stories handed down and repeated so many times they are believed one of the silliest of them is that mormons have horns years ago i was at a symposium at a college in oregon present were a catholic bishop a rabbi an episcopalian minister an evangelical minister a unitarian clergyman and myself the president of the school dr bennett hosted a breakfast one of them asked which wife i had brought i told them i had a choice of one for a second i thought that i was being singled out for embarrassment then someone asked the catholic bishop if he had brought his wife the next question came from dr bennett to me is it true that mormons have horns i smiled and said i comb my hair so that they cant be seen dr bennett who was completely bald put both hands on the top of his head and said oh you can never make a mormon out of me strangest of all otherwise intelligent people claim we are not christian this shows that they know little or nothing about us it is a true principle that you cannot lift yourself by putting others down some suppose that our high standards will repel growth it is just the opposite high standards are a magnet we are all children of god drawn to the truth and to good we face the challenge of raising families in the world in darkening clouds of wickedness some of our members are unsettled and sometimes they wonder is there any place one can go to escape from it all is there another town or a state or a country where it is safe where one can find refuge the answer generally is no the defense and the refuge is where our members now live the book of mormon prophesies yea and then shall the work commence with the father among all nations in preparing the way whereby his people may be gathered home to the land of their inheritance 3 nephi 2128 those who come out of the world into the church keep the commandments honor the priesthood and enter into activity have found the refuge a few weeks ago in one of our meetings elder robert c oaks one of the seven presidents of the seventy a retired fourstar general and commander of nato air forces in central europe reminded us of an accord signed by 10 nations on board the battleship missouri in tokyo bay on september 2 1945 which ended world war ii some of us were in asia at the time said elder general oaks i cant even imagine a circumstance today in which such a meeting could be held or such an accord could be signed to end the war against terrorism and wickedness in which we are engaged it is not that kind of war we are not to be afraid even in a world where the hostilities will never end the war of opposition that was prophesied in the revelations continues today we are to be happy and positive we are not to be afraid fear is the opposite of faith we know that activity in the church centers in the family wherever members are in the world they should establish a family where children are welcome and treasured as an heritage of the lord psalm 1273 a worthy latterday saint family is a standard to the world not only are we to maintain the highest of standards but each of us is to be a standard a defense a refuge we are to let our light so shine before men that they may see our good works and glorify our father which is in heaven matthew 516 see also 3 nephi 1216 all the struggles and exertions of past generations have brought to us in our day the fulness of the gospel of jesus christ the authority to administer and the wherewithal to accomplish the ministry it all comes together in this dispensation of the fulness of times in the which the consummation of all things will be completed and the earth prepared for the coming of the lord we are as much a part of this work as were those men who untied that yellow bandana from willard richardss walking stick and descended from ensign peak that bandana waved aloft signaled the great gathering which had been prophesied in ancient and modern scriptures we speak of the church as our refuge our defense there is safety and protection in the church it centers in the gospel of jesus christ latterday saints learn to look within themselves to see the redeeming power of the savior of all mankind the principles of the gospel taught in the church and learned from the scriptures become a guide for each of us individually and for our families we know that the homes we establish and those of our descendants will be the refuge spoken of in the revelationsthe light the standard the ensign for all nations and the refuge against the gathering storms see dc 11556 isaiah 1112 2 nephi 2112 the ensign to which all of us are to rally is jesus christ the son of god the only begotten of the father whose church this is and whose name we bear and whose authority we carry we look forward with faith we have seen many events in our lifetime and many will yet occur that will tax our courage and extend our faith we are to rejoice and be exceeding glad for great will be our reward in heaven matthew 512 willingly defend the history of the church and do not be ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth romans 116 we will face the challenges for we cannot avoid them and teach the gospel of jesus christ and teach of him as our savior and our refuge our redeemer if a wellworn yellow bandana was good enough to be an ensign to the world then ordinary men who hold the priesthood and ordinary women and ordinary children in ordinary families living the gospel as best they can all over the world can shine forth as a standard a defense a refuge against whatever is to be poured out upon the earth we talk of christ we rejoice in christ we preach of christ we prophesy of christ and we write according to our prophecies that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins 2 nephi 2526 this church will prosper it will prevail of this i am absolutely certain i bear this testimony in the name of jesus christ amen notes see journal of wilford woodruff july 26 1847 archives of the church of jesus christ of
