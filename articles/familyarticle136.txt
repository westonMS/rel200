i am the light which ye shall hold up by susan w tanner young women general president imagesusan w tanner each of our christlike deeds may share only a pinpoint of light but added together they begin to make a significant difference i remember a simple sampler that i crossstitched as a young primary girl it said i will bring the light of the gospel into my home i wondered what is that light jesus christ himself explained it best when he was teaching the nephites he said therefore hold up your light that it may shine unto the world then he explained i am the light which ye shall hold upthat which ye have seen me do 3 ne 1824 emphasis added what had the nephites seen him do and could i possibly do those things in my home when the people desired for him to tarry with them a little longer he had compassion upon them and lingered with them then he healed them prayed with them taught them wept with them blessed their little children one by one fed them and administered and shared the sacrament that they might covenant to always remember him his ministry among them was about teaching and caring for each individual and about completing the work his father had commanded him to do there was no thought for himself as i learned this there began for me a lifelong quest to bring his light into my home through selfless christlike acts this is not an easy task good home life often goes unrecognized it might be easier to arise and shine forth that thy light may be a standard for the nations dc 1155 emphasis added rather than that your light may be a standard for your own families sometimes others dont see us doing good sharing our light in our individual homes it is basic human nature to desire and seek praise and attention helaman taught his sons nephi and lehi to do the good works of their forefathers for whom they were named that ye may not do these things that ye may boast but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure in heaven hel 58 good works should not be done for the purpose of receiving recognition charles dickens has a character in the book bleak house a mrs jellyby whose flaw he labels as telescopic philanthropy she is so consumed with helping a suffering tribe in a distant land that she dismisses her own bruised and dirty child who comes to her in need of comfort mrs jellyby wants to make sure her good works are grandiose and visible to all see charles dickens bleak house 1985 8287 maybe some of us would rather help with hurricane relief than home relief now both are important but home relief is our primary and eternal responsibility parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness to provide for their physical and spiritual needs the family a proclamation to the world liahona oct 2004 49 ensign nov 1995 102 another literary figure comes to my mind who is quite the opposite of dickenss character dorothea is the heroine in one of my favorite novels middlemarch she is remembered at the end of the book for her quiet selfless deeds to family and friends it says her full nature spent itself in channels which had no great name on the earth but the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life and rest in unvisited tombs george eliot middlemarch 1986 682 in these preparatory years you young women spend much of your time in schools or jobs where you receive accolades honors awards ribbons or trophies when you move from that stage to young motherhood there is a dramatic dropoff in outside commendation yet in no other capacity is there more opportunity to serve selflessly as christ would do by taking care of hundreds of daily physical emotional and spiritual needs you will bring the light of the gospel into your homesnot to be seen of others but to build othersmen and women of strength and light homes are also private places so unfortunately we often let down in our homes and with our families we sometimes become our worst selves with the people who matter the most in our lives i distinctly remember one morning when i was 14 years old before i left for school i was cross and unkind with my parents and my brothers after i left the house i was polite with the bus driver and friendly to my peers i felt the discrepancy of my actions and a huge feeling of remorse came over me i asked the teacher if i could be excused for a few minutes to call home i apologized to my mother for my behavior and told her how much i loved and appreciated her and promised to do better at showing it it is difficult for most of us to live even one day in our homes with no contention the nephite nation had a perfect society for 200 years with no contention in the land and there were no envyings nor strifes nor tumults nor whoredoms nor lyings nor murders nor any manner of lasciviousness and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of god 4 ne 11516 some of us are born into families with very difficult problems and even good families have many challenges we must try to do in our homes what christ did with the nephites as the proclamation on the family teaches happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the lord jesus christ liahona oct 2004 49 ensign nov 1995 102 we must be the light to help our families overcome sin anger envy and fighting we can pray together weep for each other heal each others wounds and selflessly love and serve one another you young women are preparing now to strengthen your future homes and families by bringing the light of the gospel into your current homes and families small seemingly insignificant things you do can make a big difference i read about some small glowworms found in caves in new zealand each one by itself produces only an insignificant pinpoint of light but when millions of them light up a cave one by one they produce enough light by which one can actually read likewise each of our little deeds may share only a pinpoint of light but added together they begin to make a significant difference tonight the choir will remind us of the importance of sharing our little lights as they sing shine on my light is but a little one my light of faith and prayer but lo it glows like gods great sun for it was lighted there i may not hide my little light the lord has

placing on a pillow at night a thankyou note to a parent forgiving an offense bearing our testimonies in romania i met raluca a 17yearold young woman who had recently joined the church her baptism was a happy event because among other things her whole family attended her mother and sister felt the spirit there and wanted to have the missionary discussions too this concerned the father for he felt he was losing all of his family to this unfamiliar church so he did not allow it and for a time there was a feeling of discord in their family however raluca remembered that she had made a baptismal covenant to take upon her the name of jesus christ she tried to hold up his light by doing in her home the things he would do she was a peacemaker she was an example she was a teacher she was a healer eventually her fathers heart softened and he allowed the others to learn more about the church then they too were baptized and finally much to everyones joy the father of the family also joined the church at his baptism he spoke and said that for a time their family had been as two hearts beating at a different rhythm in the same household but now they were of one faith and one baptism with their hearts knit together in unity and love he gave thanks to the missionaries and members who had helped them then he paid a special tribute to his daughter raluca for being so christlike in their home during that difficult period for being the peacemaker the healer the teacher the example and the light that eventually brought their entire family to the church of jesus christ each of you has light as i look into your faces here tonight and as i remember your faces that i have seen as i have traveled throughout the world i see light glowing in your countenances even as the faces of angels

we do that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us hel 540 they were taught to repent and have faith in jesus christ as they did this the cloud of darkness dispersed and they were
