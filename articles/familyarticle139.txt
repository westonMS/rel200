be thou an example by president thomas s monson first counselor in the first presidency imagepresident thomas s monson you can share your testimony in many waysby the words you speak by the example you set by the manner in which you live your life my dear sisters both those of you assembled in the magnificent conference center and those receiving the proceedings by satellite throughout the world i pray for an interest in your prayers that i may rise to the responsibility which is mine to address you we have been edified and inspired by the messages of the young women presidency the beautiful music rendered and the very spirit of this meeting we have received a renewed appreciation for the prophet joseph smith for his life and for the restored gospel of jesus christ the first presidency of the church loves you and has confidence in you and in your leaders you are an example of righteousness in a world which desperately needs your influence and your strength perhaps your battle cry might well be the charge given by the apostle paul to his beloved timothy be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity1 today permissiveness immorality pornography and the power of peer pressure cause many to be tossed on a sea of sin and crushed on the jagged reefs of lost opportunities forfeited blessings and shattered dreams precious young women and you mothers young women leaders and advisers may i leave with you a code of conduct to guide your footsteps safely through mortality and to the celestial kingdom of our heavenly father i have divided my code of conduct into four parts you have a heritage honor it you will meet temptation withstand it you know the truth live it you possess a testimony share it first you have a heritage honor it there come thundering to our ears the words from mount sinai honour thy father and thy mother2 my how your parents love you how they pray for you honor them how do you honor your parents i like the words of william shakespeare they do not love that do not show their love3 there are countless ways in which you can show true love to your mothers and your fathers you can obey them and follow their teachings for they will never lead you astray you can treat them with respect they have sacrificed much and continue to sacrifice in your behalf be honest with your mother and your father one reflection of such honesty with parents is to communicate with them avoid the silent treatment the clock ticks more loudly its hands move more slowly when the night is dark the hour is late and a precious daughter has not yet come home if you are detained make a telephone call mom dad were ok just stopped for something to eat dont worry were fine be home soon a number of years ago while attending a youth gathering at the clarkston utah cemetery where each of the group viewed the memorial which marks the grave of martin harris one of the three witnesses to the book of mormon i noticed another markera small stone in which was inscribed a name and this poignant verse a light from our household is gone a voice we loved is stilled a place is vacant in our hearts that never can be filled dont wait until that light from your household is gone dont wait until that voice you know is stilled before you say i love you mother i love you father now is the time to think and the time to thank i trust you will do both you have a heritage honor it next in our code of conduct you will meet temptation withstand it the prophet joseph smith faced temptation can you imagine the ridicule the scorn the mocking that must have been heaped upon him as he declared that he had seen a vision i suppose it became almost unbearable for the boy he no doubt knew that it would be easier to retract his statements concerning the vision and just get on with a normal life he did not however give in these are his words i had actually seen a light and in the midst of that light i saw two personages and they did in reality speak to me and though i was hated and persecuted for saying that i had seen a vision yet it was true i had seen a vision i knew it and i knew that god knew it and i could not deny it4 joseph smith taught courage by example he faced temptation and withstood it many of you are familiar with the play camelot id like to share with you one of my favorite lines from this production as the difficulties among king arthur sir lancelot and queen guinevere deepen king arthur cautions we must not let our passions destroy our dreams this plea i would leave with you tonight do not let your passions destroy your dreams withstand temptation remember the words from the book of mormon wickedness never was happiness5 essential to your success and happiness is the advice choose your friends with caution we tend to become like those whom we admire and they are usually our friends we should associate with those who like us are planning not for temporary convenience shallow goals or narrow ambitionbut rather with those who value the things that matter most even eternal objectives maintain an eternal perspective let there be a temple marriage in your future there is no scene so sweet no time so sacred as that very special day of your marriage then and there you glimpse celestial joy be alert do not permit temptation to rob you of this blessing make every decision you contemplate pass this test what does it do to me what does it do for me and let your code of conduct emphasize not what will others think but rather what will i think of myself be influenced by that still small voice remember that one with authority placed his hands on your head at the time of your confirmation and said receive the holy ghost open your hearts even your very souls to the sound of that special voice which testifies of truth as the prophet isaiah promised thine ears shall hear a word saying this is the way walk ye in it6 the tenor of our times is permissiveness all around us we see the idols of the movie screen the heroes of the athletic fieldthose whom many young people long to emulateas disregarding the laws of god and rationalizing away sinful practices seemingly with no ill effect dont you believe it there is a time of reckoningeven a balancing of the ledger every cinderella has her midnightits called judgment day even the big exam of life are you prepared are you pleased with your own performance help can come to you from many sources one is your patriarchal blessing such a blessing contains chapters from your book of eternal possibilities read your blessing frequently study it carefully be guided by its cautions live to merit its promises now if any has stumbled in her journey there is a way back the process is called repentance our savior died to provide you and me that blessed gift though the path is difficult the promise is real though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow7 and i will remember them no more8 you will meet temptation it is my prayer that you will withstand it next in our code of conduct you know the truth live it after joseph smiths vision in the sacred grove he received no additional communication for three years can you imagine how you would feel if you had seen god the father and jesus christ his son if christ had spoken to you and then you had no additional word or communication for three years would you begin to doubt would you wonder or question why the prophet joseph smith did not wonder he did not question he did not doubt the lord he had received the truth and he lived it my dear young friends you have been reserved to come forth at this particular time when the gospel of jesus christ has been restored to the earth speaking of the gospel and of testimony president gordon b hinckley said the thing which we call testimony is as real and powerful as any force on the earth it is found in young and old it brings with it the assurance that life is purposeful that some things are of far greater importance than others that we are on an eternal journey that we are answerable unto god9 you have been taught the truths of the gospel by your parents and by your teachers in the church you will continue to find truth in the scriptures in the teachings of the prophets and through the inspiration which comes to you as you bend your knees and seek the help of god remember faith and doubt cannot exist in the mind at the same time for one will dispel the other cast out doubt cultivate faith strive always to retain that childlike faith which can move mountains and bring heaven closer to heart and home when firmly planted your testimony of the gospel of the savior and of our heavenly father will influence all that you do throughout your life it will help to determine how you spend your time and with whom you choose to associate it will affect the way you treat your family how you interact with others it will bring love peace and joy into your life it should help you determine to be modest in your dress and in your speech in the past year or so we have noticed a dramatic change in the way some of our young women are dressing styles in clothing change fads come and go but if the dress styles are immodest it is important that our young women avoid them when you dress modestly you show respect for your heavenly father and for yourself at this time when dress fashions are styled after the skimpy clothing some of the current movie and music idols are wearing it may be difficult to find modest apparel in clothing stores however it is possible and it is important the apostle paul declared know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you the temple of god is holy which temple ye are10 you know the truth live it finally you possess a testimony share it never underestimate the farreaching influence of your testimony you can strengthen one another you have the capacity to notice the unnoticed when you have eyes to see ears to hear and hearts to feel you can reach out and rescue others of your age to illustrate may i share with you an experience which took place several years ago when sister monson had been hospitalized because of a fall she asked me to go to the supermarket and purchase a few items this was something i had not done before i had a shopping list which included potatoes i promptly found a grocery cart and placed a number of potatoes in it i knew nothing of the plastic bags in which purchases are normally placed as i moved the cart along the potatoes fell out and onto the floor exiting through two rather small openings in the back of the cart a dutiful clerk hurried to my aid and called out let me help you i tried to explain to her that my cart was defective it was only then that i was told that all the carts had those two holes in the back and that they were meant for the legs of children next the clerk took my list and helped me find each item then she said you are bishop monson arent you i answered that many years earlier i had indeed been a bishop she continued at that time i lived on gale street in your ward and was not a member of the church you made certain the girls who were members contacted me each week and took me with them to mutual and other activities they were fine young women whose friendship and kindness touched my heart i want to let you know that the fellowshipping you arranged for me led to my being baptized and confirmed a member of the church what a blessing this has been in my life she said and i thank you for your kindness you can share your testimony in many waysby the words you speak by the example you set by the manner in which you live your life may each of us emulate the prophet josephs great example he taught the truth he lived the truth he shared the truth you possess a testimony share it my dear sisters may god bless you we love you we pray for you remember that you do not walk alone the lord has promised you i will go before your face i will be on your right hand and on your left and my spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up11 tomorrow is easter on this easter eve may our thoughts turn to him who atoned for our sins who showed us the way to live how to pray and who demonstrated by his own actions how we might do so born in a stable cradled in a manger the son of god beckons to each of us to follow him oh sweet the joy this sentence gives i know that my redeemer lives12 may his spirit be with you always i pray in his holy nameeven jesus christ the lordamen notes 1
