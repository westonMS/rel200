personal peace in challenging times by elder quentin l cook of the quorum of the twelve apostles it has never been more important to seek personal peace i was recently assigned to dedicate a portion of historic nauvoo as part of the assignment i was able to visit liberty jail in missouri as i viewed the jail i contemplated the events that make it such a significant part of church history the lives of the saints were threatened as the result of an extermination order issued by the governor of missouri in addition the prophet joseph and a few choice associates had been unjustly imprisoned in liberty jail one of the reasons for the violent opposition to our members was most of them were opposed to slavery1 this intense persecution of joseph smith and his followers constitutes an extreme example of the unrighteous exercise of agency that can impact righteous people josephs time in liberty jail demonstrates that adversity is not evidence of the lords disfavor nor a withdrawal of his blessings i was deeply moved as i read what the prophet joseph smith declared as he was confined in liberty jail o god where art thou and where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place2 joseph inquired how long the lords people would suffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions3 imageelder cook visiting liberty jail as i stood in liberty jail i was deeply touched as i read the lords answer my son peace be unto thy soul thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment and then if thou endure it well god shall exalt thee on high4 it is clear that opposition can refine us for an eternal celestial destiny5 the saviors precious words my son peace be unto thy soul6 resonate with me personally and have great significance for our day they remind me of his teachings to his disciples during his mortal ministry prior to christs suffering in the garden of gethsemane and on the cross he commanded his apostles to love one another as i have loved you7 and subsequently comforted them with these words peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid8 one of the most cherished titles of our lord and savior jesus christ is prince of peace9 ultimately his kingdom will be established including peace and love10 we look forward to the millennial reign of the messiah notwithstanding this vision of the millennial reign we know that world peace and harmony are not prevalent in our day11 in my lifetime i have never seen a greater lack of civility we are bombarded with angry contentious language and provocative devastating actions that destroy peace and tranquility peace in the world is not promised or assured until the second coming of jesus christ the savior instructed his apostles that his earthly mission would not achieve universal peace he taught think not that i am come to send peace on earth12 universal peace was not part of the saviors initial mortal ministry universal peace does not exist today however personal peace can be achieved despite the anger contention and division that blight and corrupt our world today it has never been more important to seek personal peace a beautiful and beloved new hymn written for todays youth by brother nik day titled peace in christ declares when theres no peace on earth there is peace in christ13 we were blessed to have this hymn just before the worldwide covid19 pandemic this hymn reflects in a beautiful fashion the aspiration for peace and appropriately emphasizes that peace is anchored in the life and mission of jesus christ president joseph f smith declared there never can come to the world that spirit of peace and love until mankind will receive gods truth and gods message and acknowledge his power and authority which is divine14 while we will never retreat from efforts to achieve universal peace we have been assured that we can have personal peace as christ teaches this principle is set forth in the doctrine and covenants but learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward even peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come15 what are some of the works of righteousness that will help us deal with disputations and lessen contention and find peace in this world all of christs teachings point in this direction i will mention a few which i believe are particularly important first love god live his commandments and forgive everyone president george albert smith became president of the church in 1945 he had been known during his years as an apostle as a peaceloving leader in the preceding 15 years before he became president the challenges and trials of a massive worldwide depression followed by the death and destruction of world war ii had been anything but peaceful at the conclusion of world war ii during his first general conference as president in october 1945 president smith reminded the saints of the saviors invitation to love their neighbors and forgive their enemies and then taught that is the spirit all latterday saints should seek to possess if they hope some day to stand in his presence and receive at his hands a glorious welcome home16 second seek the fruits of the spirit the apostle paul in his epistle to the galatians sets forth the dichotomy between works of righteousness that qualify us to inherit the kingdom of god and works that can without repentance disqualify us among those that qualify us are the fruits of the spirit love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness and temperance17 paul also includes bearing one anothers burdens and being not weary in welldoing18 among those works that are not righteous he includes hatred wrath and strife19 one of the great lessons in the old testament period relates to father abraham abraham and lot his nephew were wealthy but found they could not dwell together to eliminate strife abraham allowed lot to choose the land he wanted lot chose the plain of jordan which was both well watered and beautiful abraham took the less fertile plain of mamre the scriptures read that abraham then pitched his tent and built an altar unto the lord20 lot on the other hand pitched his tent toward sodom21 to have peaceful relationships the lesson is clear we should be willing to compromise and eliminate strife with respect to matters that do not involve righteousness as king benjamin taught ye will not have a mind to injure one another but to live peaceably22 but on conduct relating to righteousness and doctrinal imperatives we need to remain firm and steadfast if we want to have the peace which is the reward of the works of righteousness we will not pitch our tents toward the world we will pitch our tents toward the temple third exercise agency to choose righteousness peace and agency are intertwined as essential elements of the plan of salvation as described in the gospel topics article agency and accountability agency is the ability and privilege god gives us to choose and to act for ourselves23 thus agency is at the heart of the personal growth and experience that bless us as we follow the savior24 agency was a principal issue in the premortal council in heaven and the conflict between those who chose to follow christ and the followers of satan25 letting go of pride and control and choosing the savior would allow us to have his light and his peace but personal peace would be challenged when people exercised their agency in harmful and hurtful ways i am confident that the peaceful assurance we felt in our hearts was strengthened by the knowledge we had of what the savior of the world would accomplish in our behalf this is beautifully set forth in preach my gospel as we rely on the atonement of jesus christ he can help us endure our trials sicknesses and pain we can be filled with joy peace and consolation all that is unfair about life can be made right through the atonement of jesus christ26 fourth build zion in our hearts and homes we are children of god and part of his family we are also part of the family into which we are born the institution of the family is the foundation for both happiness and peace president russell m nelson has taught usand during this pandemic we have learnedthat the homecentered churchsupported religious observance can unleash the power of families to transform our homes into a sanctuary of faith27 if we have this religious observance in our homes we will also have the saviors peace28 we are aware that many of you do not have the blessings of righteous homes and contend regularly with those who choose unrighteousness the savior can provide protection and peace to guide you ultimately to safety and shelter from lifes storms i assure you that the joy love and fulfillment experienced in loving righteous families produce both peace and happiness love and kindness are at the center of having zion in our hearts and homes29 fifth follow the current admonitions of our prophet our peace is greatly enhanced when we follow the lords prophet president russell m nelson we will shortly have an opportunity to hear from him he was prepared from the foundations of the world for this calling his personal preparation has been most remarkable30 he has taught us that we can feel enduring peace and joy even during turbulent times as we strive to become more like our savior jesus christ31 he has counseled us to repent daily to receive the lords cleansing healing and strengthening power32 i am a personal witness that revelation has been received and continues to be received from heaven by our beloved prophet while we honor and sustain him as our prophet we worship our heavenly father and our savior jesus christ we are ministered to by the holy ghost i testify and provide my personal apostolic witness that jesus christ the savior and redeemer of the world leads and guides his restored church his life and atoning mission are the true source of peace he is the prince of peace i bear my sure and solemn witness that he lives in the name of jesus christ amen notes people in independence did not like that the saints preached to

fortunate to grow up in a home where peace prevailed this was primarily due to the influence of our mother who was a faithful member of the church my father was outstanding in every way but was less active mother honored our father and avoided contention she taught us as children to pray and attend church she also taught us to love and serve each other see mosiah 41415 growing up in such a home provided peace and has been a great blessing in my life russell m nelson graduated from the university of utah medical school first in his class at age 22 he had long desired to be a surgeon and received the best training available at major medical institutions he faithfully fulfilled military commitments in korea and japan for many years he was a pioneer in openheart surgery and was
