out of small things by kathleen h hughes first counselor in the relief society general presidency imagekathleen h hughes we must not become weary of doing good and we must not become impatient the changes we seek will come about in their time the words of the grand anthem of the restoration sung at the opening of our meeting have been in my mind and heart since we first chose the theme let zion in her beauty rise her light begins to shine a people to prepare to meet the lord let zion in her beauty rise hymns no 41 its glorious to think of that promised time when the lord will return but its also sobering to contemplate the changes that may be necessary for us each to be prepared still dear sisters as i have met you and seen your commitment i believe we are not as a people as wanting as we often feel we have reason for confidence and hope as we prepare september 1832 was a busy season of preparation for the early saints the prophet was preparing to move to the john johnson home southeast of kirtland ohio other brethren were preparing to leave for missouri in the midst of these preparations joseph smith received the revelation that we now know as section 64 of the doctrine and covenants after instructing the men going to missouri the lord reminded them but all things must come to pass in their time wherefore be not weary in welldoing for ye are laying the foundation of a great work and out of small things proceedeth that which is great dc 643233 emphasis added these verses are a guide for us as we prepare ourselves and our families to live in perilous times see 2 tim 31 we must not become weary of doing good and we must not become impatient the changes we seek will come about in their time most important the great work we wish to do will proceed from small things one of those small things i have learned is that i must find the time to fill my own spiritual reservoir each day its tempting to make a massive list of my failings and then to work at them as a friend of mine says as though i am killing snakes selfimprovement may seem a kind of work project but it isat hearta change of heart when we women struggle to keep up with liferaising children providing necessities attending school dealing with issues of age or ill healthour own spirituality often ends up at the bottom of our long to do lists scripture study and prayer will bring changebut not automatically if we read with one eye and pray with half a heart we are engaging in a ritual and while that time is not worthless it isnt fully productive either we need with the support of family to clear enough time to studynot just readto contemplate feel and wait for answers the lord has promised that he will strengthen us fortify and refresh us if we will take time for him each day see dc 8863 sisters we must prepare if we wish to serve and we must serve if we wish to prepare when i was 16 i was called to teach the threeyearolds in what was then called junior sunday school you know there was such a thing in the olden days i taught some busy children they climbed on and under the chairs and table and never seemed to stop moving i was dreadfully inexperienced and during the first few weeks i wondered if i had done the right thing in accepting the call but i persisted and what i learnedquicklywas that i couldnt just pray for help i had to be prepared that meant planning activities stories and lessons and it meant having plan b ready along with c through z many years later when i was called to lead a junior sunday school i knew how to assist new teachers i knew how to enjoy the children and i knew the importance of being faithful in my calling i like many of you have had numerous callings in the church some have been easier for me than others but i have tried to magnify each one but does the phrase magnify your calling ever make you nervous it has worried me recently i read a talk in which president thomas s monson said on the subject and how does one magnify a calling simply by performing the service that pertains to it priesthood power liahona jan 2000 60 ensign nov 1999 51 sisters we can do that i hear women say that their callings are wearing them out or that they dont have time to serve but magnifying our callings does not mean staying up all night preparing handouts and elaborate table decorations it does not mean that each time we do our visiting teaching we have to take something to our sisters sometimes we are our own worst enemies lets simplify the message of a good lesson comes through spiritual preparation lets put our focus on the principles of the gospel and on the material in our study guides lets prepare to create an interesting exchange of ideas through discussion not through extra invented work that makes us so weary we come to resent the time we spend in fulfilling our callings when we are called to serve we are not offered a release date our lives are our service lois bonner a woman in my stake who is 92 years old began serving as a visiting teacher when she married over 65 years ago she still faithfully serves the nelsons from canada and the ellsworths from utah as missionaries taught mentored and loved those of us who were in a small growing ward in missouri we learned through them the joy of service and benefited from the wisdom of their experiences i can think of no better way to thank our father for all he gives us than to serve his children in every age of our lives finally im coming to understand the meaning and importance of our offeringsspecifically our tithes and fast offerings throughout the doctrine and covenants the lord admonishes us to care for each other and to give of our temporal resources to build the kingdom of god in fact our willingness to do this is one of the prerequisites for the lords returning to the earth see daniel h ludlow a companion to your study of the doctrine and covenants 2 vols 1978 246 though each of our circumstances may differ it is important for us to give all that we can the lord has seldom required individuals to give all but it is important for him to know that we would and could do it if asked see bruce r mcconkie obedience consecration and sacrifice ensign may 1975 50 in one stake where my husband and i lived our stake president challenged members to double their fast offerings and prepare for the blessings that would come i can now bear personal testimony that the lord will bless us in unfathomable ways if we are true and faithful in giving generously spirituality through prayer and study service to others generous tithes and offerings these are not new principles these are some of the small things that are prerequisites to that which is great in the verse that follows we learn what the lord requires of us he requires the heart and a willing mind dc 6434 emphasis added it is our hearts and our minds that must be made new we each have our failings our weaknesses our lessthanperfect attitudes the lord asks us to open ourselves to him holding nothing back he says to us seek not thine own life seek my will and to keep my commandments hel 104 the newness of heart comes when we do and give all we can then offer our heart and will to the father as we do this our father promises us that our lives now and in eternity will be abundant we need not fear sisters dont become weary in doing good if we are patient we can experience the change of heart we seek for most of us this will require only a slight change of course sending us toward true north the adjustments we must make are in those small things but that does not mean they are easy too many forces are confusing our compass but the pull to the polar star is one we recognize it is the direction toward home i bear witness to you of the reality of the promises of the father to us his beloved daughters i testify that as we attune our lives to emulate the life shown us by the savior we will know that the light of zion is arising that we are becoming a people prepared for his return in the name of jesus christ amen
