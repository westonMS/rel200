with all the feeling of a tender parent a message of hope to families by elder robert d hales of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder robert d hales no matter how evil the world becomes our families can be at peace if we do whats right we will be guided and protected as paul prophesied we live in perilous times1 satan has been going about leading away the hearts of the people2 and his influence is increasing but no matter how evil the world becomes our families can be at peace if we do whats right we will be guided and protected the hymn often sung by our pioneer ancestors tells us what to do gird up your loins fresh courage take our god will never us forsake3 that courage and faith is what we need as parents and families in these latter days father lehi had such courage he loved his family and rejoiced that some of his children kept the lords commandments but he must have been heartbroken when his sons laman and lemuel partook not of the fruit representing the love of god he exceedingly feared for them yea he feared lest they should be cast off from the presence of the lord4 every parent faces moments of such fear however when we exercise our faith by teaching our children and doing what we can to help them our fears will diminish lehi girded up his loins and with faith he did exhort his children with all the feeling of a tender parent that they would hearken to his words that perhaps the lord would be merciful to them and he bade them to keep the commandments of the lord5 we too must have the faith to teach our children and bid them to keep the commandments we should not let their choices weaken our faith our worthiness will not be measured according to their righteousness lehi did not lose the blessing of feasting at the tree of life because laman and lemuel refused to partake of its fruit sometimes as parents we feel we have failed when our children make mistakes or stray parents are never failures when they do their best to love teach pray and care for their children their faith prayers and efforts will be consecrated to the good of their children the lords desire for us as parents is that we keep his commandments he has said teach your children light and truth according to the commandments set in order your own house see that you are more diligent and concerned at home6 i want to remind all of us today that no family has reached perfection all families are subject to the conditions of mortality all of us are given the gift of agencyto choose for ourselves and to learn from the consequences of our choices any of us may experience a spouse a child a parent or a member of our extended family suffering in one way or anothermentally physically emotionally or spirituallyand we may experience these tribulations ourselves at times in short mortality is not easy each family has its own special circumstances but the gospel of jesus christ addresses every challengewhich is why we must teach it to our children the family a proclamation to the world states parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness to provide for their physical and spiritual needs to teach them to love and serve one another to observe the commandments of god and to be lawabiding citizens wherever they live husbands and wivesmothers and fatherswill be held accountable before god for the discharge of these obligations7 fulfilling these obligations is the key to protecting our families in these last days moses counseled and thou shalt teach these words diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up8 our families should be in our thoughts continually moses understood the need for constant teaching for he grew up in difficult times at the time moses was born pharaoh had declared that every hebrew male infant in egypt should be cast into the river but moses parents took seriously their parental duties the scriptures record by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents and his parents were not afraid of the kings commandment9 when moses grew too old to be concealed his mother jochebed constructed an ingenious basket of bulrushes waterproofed it with slime and pitch and placed her son inside she directed the tiny vessel down the river to a safe placeto where the pharaohs daughter bathed leaving nothing to chance jochebed also sent along an inspired helper her daughter miriam to keep watch when pharaohs daughter the princess found the baby miriam bravely offered to call a hebrew nurse that nurse was jochebed moses mother10 because of her faithfulness moses life was spared in time he learned who he really was and he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king11 i join with faithful parents everywhere in declaring that we know who we are we understand our responsibilities as parents and we do not fear the wrath of the prince of darkness we trust in the light of the lord like jochebed we raise our families in a wicked and hostile worlda world as dangerous as the courts of egypt ruled by pharaoh but like jochebed we also weave around our children a protective basketa vessel called the familyand guide them to safe places where our teachings can be reinforced in the home and at church ultimately we guide them to the greatest of all houses of learningthe holy temple where one day they can kneel surrounded by their faithful family members to be sealed for time and all eternity to a worthy companion what they learned from us they will teach their children and the work of eternal families will go on along the way at times when our children are away from us the lord provides inspired miriams to watch over themspecial thirdparty helpers such as priesthood and auxiliary leaders teachers extended family and worthy friends sometimes the spirit prompts us as parents to seek special help beyond ourselves through such resources as doctors and qualified counselors the spirit will direct when and how such help should be obtained but the greatest help for our families comes through the gospelfrom our heavenly father through the guidance of the holy ghost in the doctrines and principles and through the priesthood may i share with you five important elements of parenting that will assist us in strengthening our families hold family councils sometimes we are afraid of our childrenafraid to counsel with them for fear of offending them there are priceless blessings to be obtained from counseling together with our families showing a genuine interest in the lives of our family members occasionally family councils may involve all family members as part of a family home evening or other special gatherings but we should regularly counsel with each of our children individually without this oneonone counseling together with our children they are prone to believe that dad and mom or grandpa and grandma dont understand or care about the challenges they are facing as we listen with love and refrain from interrupting the spirit will help us learn how we can be of help to our children and teach them for example we may teach them that they can choose their actions but not the consequences of those actions we can also gently help them understand what the consequences of their actions may be in their own lives sometimes when our teachings arent heeded and when our expectations are not met we need to remind ourselves to leave the door to our hearts open in the parable of the prodigal son we find a powerful lesson for families and especially parents after the younger son came to himself12 he decided to go home how did he know his father wouldnt reject him because he knew his father through the inevitable misunderstandings conflicts and follies of the sons youth i can visualize his father being there with an understanding and compassionate heart a soft answer a listening ear and a forgiving embrace i can also imagine his son knowing he could come home because he knew the kind of home that was awaiting him for the scriptures say when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him13 i testify that our heavenly father leaves the door open i also testify that it is never too late to open the door between us and our children with simple words such as i love you i am sorry and please forgive me we can begin now to create a home they will want to return tonot only now but in the eternities we can also help our obedient children leave the door of forgiveness open by expressing our love and appreciation to them and by helping them rejoice in the repentance of their siblings with the door to our hearts open we should learn how to liken the scriptures to our lives we often talk about teaching our children from the scriptures but how do we do that several years ago i was teaching our young son about the life and experiences of the brother of jared although the story was very interesting he was not engaged i then asked what the story meant to him personally it means so much when we ask our children what does it mean to you he said you know its not that different from what joseph smith did in the grove when he prayed and got an answer i said youre about josephs age do you think a prayer like his would be helpful to you suddenly we werent talking about a longago story in a faraway land we were talking about our sonabout his life his needs and the way prayer could help him as parents we have the responsibility to help our children to liken all scriptures indeed every part of the gospel of jesus christ unto us and unto our children for the profit and learning of our families14 are we likening all of our childrens gospel experiences to the real needs in their lives are we teaching them about the gift of the holy ghost repentance the atonement the sacrament and the blessing of sacrament meeting as they meet the challenges in their lives there is not enough time in formal meetings to teach our children everything they need to know therefore we must take advantage of everyday teaching moments these moments are priceless they come when we are working playing and struggling together when they come the spirit of the lord can help us know what to say and help our children accept our teaching what a joy and blessing to have the spirit in our homes and what a blessing it is to invite it through prayer studying the scriptures speaking kindly and showing appreciation to one another let us prepare our teaching moments by praying as alma prayed for his son with much faith15 and all the energy of our souls by fasting searching the scriptures repenting of our sins and allowing the holy ghost to fill our hearts with love forgiveness and compassion and then it will fill our homes then let us trust the good shepherd moses mother jochebed guided her son down the river with faith in the shepherd of our souls16 as parents we too can trust the good shepherd to guide and direct us isaiah promised he shall gently lead17 all those who bear responsibility for the young he will help us trust and honor the principles of agency opposition and the atonement even when our children make unwise decisions through his spirit he will help us teach our children to meet every challenge trial and tribulation in life by remembering who they arechildren of god we will be inspired with ways to help them put on the whole armour of god18 so that they can withstand the fiery darts of the adversary19 with the shield of faith20 and the sword of the spirit21 as our children are spiritually armed and strengthened he will bless them to endure faithfully to the end and return home worthy to stand and live in their heavenly fathers presence forever through it all we will sorrow to see our family members suffer the slings and arrows of mortality but we will stand all amazed at the love our savior offers them because of him the buffetings need not defeat and destroy them but can soften strengthen and sanctify them to parents and families throughout the world i testify that the lord jesus christ is mighty to save he is the healer the redeemer the rescuing shepherd who will leave the ninety and nine to find the one if we are seeking the salvation of special ones in our own families i bear testimony that they are within his reach we assist him in reaching them by faithfully living the gospel being sealed in the temple and living true to the covenants we make there parents can take great comfort in the words of elder orson f whitney relating the teachings of joseph smith the prophet joseph smith declaredand he never taught more comforting doctrinethat the eternal sealings of faithful parents and the divine promises made to them for valiant service in the cause of truth would save not only themselves but likewise their posterity though some of the sheep may wander the eye of the shepherd is upon them and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of divine providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold either in this life or the life to come they will return they will have to pay their debt to justice they will suffer for their sins and may tread a thorny path but if it leads them at last like the penitent prodigal to a loving and forgiving fathers heart and home the painful experience will not have been in vain pray for your careless and disobedient children hold on to them with your faith hope on trust on till you see the salvation of god22 i bear my special witness that jesus christ gave his life making possible the salvation and exaltation of all the families of the earth with all the feeling of a tender parent i express my love and the love of our heavenly father to you and your family may we gather our loved ones around us gird up our loins and fresh courage take our god will never us forsake with faith courage and love families will truly be together forever i so testify in the name of jesus christ amen notes 2 tim 31 3 ne 23 come come ye saints hymns no 30 1 ne 83536 1
