let our voices be heard by elder m russell ballard of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder m russell ballard let us speak out and encourage a more uplifting inspiring and acceptable media the fall of the year is when television airs its season premieres and introduces its new shows a friend told me that there are 37 new tv series being inaugurated this fall as he has read the reviews he has found few if any of them that he would want his children to watch most of the sitcoms dramas and reality shows contain immorality violence and subtle ridicule of traditional values and traditional families each year the new shows seem to get worse pushing the envelope of what the public will accept what comes out of hollywood off the internet and in much of todays music creates a web of decadence that can trap our children and endanger all of us church leaders have the responsibility to speak out on moral issues and to counsel individuals and families the family is the basic unit of society it is the basic unit of eternity thus when forces threaten the family church leaders must respond the family is at the heart of heavenly fathers plan because we are all part of his family and because mortality is our opportunity to form our own families and to assume the role of parents it is within our families that we learn unconditional love which can come to us and draw us very close to gods love it is within families that values are taught and character is built father and mother are callings from which we will never be released and there is no more important stewardship than the responsibility we have for gods spirit children who come into our families within this context of the preeminent importance of families and the threats families face today it is not surprising that the first presidency and the quorum of the twelve apostles used strong words in the proclamation to the world on families we warn that individuals who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before god further we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals communities and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets1 one such prophet was malachi who admonished parents to turn their hearts to their children and children to their parents lest the whole earth be cursed see mal 46 to these warnings ancient as the old testament and current as the proclamation on the family i add my own voice of warning specifically concerning todays media and the powerful negative effect it can have on families and on family life because of its sheer size media today presents vast and sharply contrasting options opposite from its harmful and permissive side media offers much that is positive and productive television offers history channels discovery channels education channels one can still find movies and tv comedies and dramas that entertain and uplift and accurately depict the consequences of right and wrong the internet can be a fabulous tool of information and communication and there is an unlimited supply of good music in the world thus our biggest challenge is to choose wisely what we listen to and what we watch as the prophet lehi said because of christ and his atonement we are free forever knowing good from evil able to act for ourselves rather than be acted upon free to choose liberty and eternal life or to choose captivity and death 2 ne 22627 the choices we make in media can be symbolic of the choices we make in life choosing the trendy the titillating the tawdry in the tv programs or movies we watch can cause us to end up if were not careful choosing the same things in the lives we live if we do not make good choices the media can devastate our families and pull our children away from the narrow gospel path in the virtual reality and the perceived reality of large and small screens familydestructive viewpoints and behavior are regularly portrayed as pleasurable as stylish as exciting and as normal often medias most devastating attacks on family are not direct or frontal or openly immoral intelligent evil is too cunning for that knowing that most people still profess belief in family and in traditional values rather the attacks are subtle and amoralissues of right and wrong dont even come up immorality and sexual innuendo are everywhere causing some to believe that because everyone is doing it it must be all right this pernicious evil is not out in the street somewhere it is coming right into our homes right into the heart of our families to be strong and happy families need to be nourished by the truths depicted in the thirteenth article of faithby a belief in being honest true chaste benevolent virtuous and in doing good to all men gratefully there are many likeminded men and women of all cultures and faiths who also seek that which is virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy but we live in the perilous times to which the apostle paul referred when he warned about our day as one when men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection false accusers despisers of those that are good heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god 2 tim 314 conspiring men and women intent on gain rather than goodness stir up the people to all manner of wickedness see alma 1120 preventing the noble uses to which the media could be employed the new morality preached from the medias pulpit is nothing more than the old immorality it attacks religion it undermines the family it turns virtue into vice and vice into virtue it assaults the senses and batters the soul with messages and images that are neither virtuous nor lovely nor of good report nor praiseworthy the time has come when members of the church need to speak out and join with the many other concerned people in opposition to the offensive destructive and meanspirited media influence that is sweeping over the earth according to the kaiser family foundation the percentage of television primetime shows with sexual content jumped from 67 percent in 1998 to 75 percent in the year 20002 media with this kind of content has numerous negative effects it fosters a callous attitude toward women who are often portrayed as objects of abuse and not as precious daughters of god who are essential to his eternal plan the longcherished values of abstinence from intimate relationships before marriage and complete fidelity between husband and wife after marriage are denigrated and derided children and youth are confused and misled by the deviant behavior they see demonstrated by socalled stars they admire and want to emulate in the moral confusion created by the media enduring values are being abandoned we see a rapid increase in cyberporn involving sexual addiction over the internet some become so addicted to viewing internet pornography and participating in dangerous online chat rooms that they ignore their marriage covenants and family obligations and often put their employment at risk many run afoul of the law others develop a tolerance to their perverted behavior taking ever more risks to feed their immoral addiction marriages crumble and relationships fail as addicts often lose everything of real eternal value according to one social observer television has replaced the family the school and the churchin that orderas the principal instrument for socialization and transmission of values greed debauchery violence unlimited selfgratification absence of moral restraint are the daily fare glamorously dished up to our children3 we must be concerned with the violent and sexually charged lyrics of much of todays popular music and the relatively new art form of the music video according to industry observers 40 percent of the music video audience is under the age of 184 one study reports that approximately threefourths of all the music videos that tell a story utilize sexual imagery and nearly half involve violence5 and the fashion trends spawned in their images are about as far away from being virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy as you can get ours surely is a time when men call evil good and good evil isa 520 let me say again that the family is the main target of evils attack and must therefore be the main point of our protection and defense as i said once before when you stop and think about it from a diabolically tactical point of view fighting the family makes sense to satan when he wants to disrupt the work of the lord he doesnt poison the worlds peanut butter supply thus bringing the churchs missionary system to its collective knees he doesnt send a plague of laryngitis to afflict the mormon tabernacle choir he doesnt legislate against green jello and casseroles when evil wants to strike out and disrupt the essence of gods work it attacks the family it does so by attempting to disregard the law of chastity to confuse gender to desensitize violence to make crude and blasphemous language the norm and to make immoral and deviant behavior seem like the rule rather than the exception we need to remember edmund burkes statement the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing6 we need to raise our voices with other concerned citizens throughout the world in opposition to current trends we need to tell the sponsors of offensive media that we have had enough we need to support programs and products that are positive and uplifting joining together with neighbors and friends who share our concerns we can send a clear message to those responsible the internet web sites and their local affiliates will have their addresses letters and emails have more effect than most people realize especially those like one sent by a relief society sister that stated i represent a group of over a hundred women that meets every week and often talks about the harm your program is doing to our children of course the most basic way to protest negativeimpact media is simply not to watch it see it read it or play it we should teach our family members to follow the first presidencys counsel to young people from the for the strength of youth pamphlet their instruction regarding entertainment and the media is very clear do not attend view or participate in entertainment that is vulgar immoral violent or pornographic in any way do not participate in entertainment that in any way presents immorality or violent behavior as acceptable have the courage to walk out of a movie or video party turn off a computer or television change a radio station or put down a magazine if what is being presented does not meet heavenly fathers standards do these things even if others do not7 brothers and sisters refuse to be used refuse to be manipulated refuse to support those programs that violate traditional family values we may be a small voice to begin with nevertheless let us speak out and encourage a more uplifting inspiring and acceptable media besides making our voices heard let me conclude with seven things that every parent can do to minimize the negative effect media can have on our families we need to hold family councils and decide what our media standards are going to be we need to spend enough quality time with our children that we are consistently the main influence in their lives not the media or any peer group we need to make good media choices ourselves and set good examples for our children we need to limit the amount of time our children watch tv or play video games or use the internet each day virtual reality must not become their reality we need to use internet filters and tv programming locks to prevent our children from chancing upon things they should not see we need to have tvs and computers in a muchused common room in the home not in a bedroom or a private place we need to take time to watch appropriate media with our children and discuss with them how to make choices that will uplift and build rather than degrade and destroy may god bless us with courage and wisdom in doing what each one of us can to help turn the tide in the media away from darkness toward truth and light and may god bless our families to be strong and true to the principles of the gospel is my humble prayer in the
