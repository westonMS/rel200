god loves his children by elder taniela b wakolo of the seventy i would like to share three specific ways our heavenly father manifests his love for us his children brothers and sisters i rejoice with you in the gospel of jesus christ i bring with me love from the resilient members in the philippines and say on their behalf mabuhay on this easter morning i testify of the living christ that he rose from the dead and that his love for us and for our father in heaven is pure and eternal today i desire to focus on the love of heavenly father and jesus christ for all which is manifest through the atonement of jesus christ for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son john 316 when the prophet nephi was asked by an angel about his knowledge of god nephi responded simply i know that he loveth his children see 1 nephi 111617 a verse from the book of mormon another testament of jesus christ powerfully describes the saviors perfect love and the world because of their iniquity shall judge him to be a thing of naught they scourge him they smite him they spit upon him and he suffereth it because of his loving kindness and his longsuffering towards the children of men 1 nephi 199 the saviors universal love is the motivating force behind all that he does we know that it is the same love our father in heaven has for us because the savior humbly taught that he and the father are one see john 1030 172023 how then do we reciprocate and show our gratitude for their universal love the savior taught us with this simple allencompassing invitation if ye love me keep my commandments john 1415 president dallin h oaks taught gods universal and perfect love is shown in all the blessings of his gospel plan including the fact that his choicest blessings are reserved for those who obey his laws1 i would like to share three specific ways our heavenly father manifests his love for us his children first relationships with god and family manifest his love our most valuable relationships are with the father and the son and with our own families because our ties to them are eternal the great plan of happiness is a wonderful manifestation of gods love for us with eyes riveted on gods plan we willingly choose to carve out soil and rocks within us that support selfish desires and replace them with foundations that build eternal relationships in a sense this can be called spiritual excavation in performing our spiritual excavation we must first seek after god and call upon him see jeremiah 291213 seeking after him and calling upon him will begin the process and provide space to build and strengthen our eternal relationships it broadens our spiritual view and helps us focus on changing what we can control rather than on fears outside our control studying the life and ministry of our savior jesus christ will enable us to view these other concerns with an eternal perspective distractions can sometimes prevent us from experiencing gods love in our family relationships and activities a mother feeling that gadgets were taking over her family relationships came up with a solution at the dinner table and at other family times she just calls out phones on the deck let us have face time she says that this is the new norm for their family and that it strengthens their relationship as a family when they have real face time they now enjoy quality come follow me discussions together as a family second he manifests his love to his children by calling prophets our current world is deluged in a war of words and tumult of opinions joseph smithhistory 110 paul reminds us that there are so many kinds of voices in the world 1 corinthians 1410 which of all the voices rise clearly and meaningfully above the fray it is the voice of gods prophets seers and revelators i remember vividly after undergoing surgery in 2018 and upon returning to work i was in the parking garage at church headquarters suddenly i heard the voice of president russell m nelson calling taniela taniela i ran toward him and he asked how i was doing i said i am recovering very well president nelson he gave me counsel and a hug i truly felt the personal ministry of a prophet to the one president nelson has traveled to many nations of the earth in my mind he is not just ministering to thousands but he is ministering to thousands of ones in doing so he shares the love god has for all his children recently the words of president nelson have been a source of strength and inspiration to the people of the philippines as with every country in the world during 2020 the philippines was severely affected by the covid19 pandemic as well as a volcanic eruption earthquakes strong typhoons and devastating floods but like a pillar of light shining through dark clouds of fear loneliness and despair came the words of the prophet they included the call for worldwide fasting and prayer and counsel to move forward despite the pandemic he invited us to make our homes personal sanctuaries of faith he called upon latterday saints everywhere to respect all of gods children and to let god prevail in our lives2 likewise stirring were president nelsons recent video testimony about the power of gratitude and his concluding prayer which resonated across the philippines3 in the province of leyte the video was played during an interfaith event and it was also mentioned as part of a priests homily the philippines along with the entire world are so blessed to feel gods love through the words of his chosen prophet third chastening can be a manifestation of gods love for his children sometimes god manifests his love by chastening us it is a way of reminding us that he loves us and that he knows who we are his promised blessing of peace is open to all those who courageously walk the covenant path and are willing to receive correction when we recognize the chastening and are willing recipients it becomes a spiritual surgery who likes surgery by the way but to those who need it and are willing to receive it it can be lifesaving the lord chastens whom he loves the scriptures tell us so see hebrews 12511 helaman 123 doctrine and covenants 127 951 that chastening or spiritual surgery will bring about needed change in our lives we will realize brothers and sisters that it refines and purifies our inner vessels joseph smith the prophet of the restoration was chastened after joseph lost the 116 pages of the book of mormon manuscript the lord both corrected and showed love by saying you should not have feared man more than god you should have been faithful behold thou art joseph and thou wast chosen remember god is merciful therefore repent doctrine and covenants 3710 in 2016 while serving a mission in little rock arkansas i asked brother cava to deliver a package to my older sister who lived on an island in fiji his response was not something that i had anticipated president wakolo he groaned your sister passed away and was buried 10 days ago i had selfpity and even felt a little upset that my family did not even bother to let me know the next day while my wife was teaching missionaries this thought penetrated my soul taniela all these experiences are for your own good and development you have been teaching and sharing your testimony about the atonement of jesus christ now live accordingly i was reminded that happy is the man whom god corrects therefore we should despise not the chastening of the almighty job 517 it was a spiritual surgery for me and the outcome was immediate just as i was contemplating the experience i was called upon to give my concluding thoughts to the discussion among other things i shared the lessons that i had just been taught one i had just been chastened by the holy ghost and i loved it because i was the only one who heard it two because of the saviors sacrifice and ransom i will no longer refer to my challenges as trials and tribulations but as my learning experiences and three because of his perfect and sinless life i will no longer refer to my shortcomings and lack of abilities as weaknesses but rather as my development opportunities this experience helped me know that god chastens us because he loves us i conclude our eternal father and his son jesus christ show their love by making it possible for us to have eternal relationships with them and our family members by calling modernday prophets to teach and minister to us and by chastening us to help us learn and grow god be thanked for the matchless gift of his divine son4 our resurrected lord even the
