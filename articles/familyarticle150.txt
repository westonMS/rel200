choose ye therefore christ the lord by anne c pingree second counselor in the relief society general presidency imageanne c pingree when a woman chooses to have christ at the center of her own heart she brings the lord into the core of her home and family sisters it is a glorious doctrine to me that we can choose to give christ all our heartthat we can choose to put our savior and redeemer at the center of our heart in each of us the restored gospel of jesus christ can be written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart1 we chose to follow christ in our first estate what joyful news it is that we can choose him each day during our sojourn on earth as covenant women living in many nations it is essential to have christ at the core of our lives in these perilous times2 oh how we need him he is the source of strength and safety he is light he is life his peace passeth all understanding3 as our personal savior and redeemer he invites us one by one with outstretched arms to come unto him4 in the most personal ways sisters when a woman accepts the saviors invitation she is strengthened individually and others are blessed through her righteous influence i believe when a woman chooses to have christ at the center of her own heart at the nucleus of her personal world she brings the lord into the core of her home and family be it a family of one or a family of many wherever she lives and whatever her circumstances as the heart of the home and the family what is in each womans heart is reflected in the environment and spirit of her home while we were on an assignment in japan a church leader invited us to visit his home we were honored to have this opportunity but wondered what his wife would think of her husbands lastminute invitation to bring visitors from salt lake city home en route the man telephoned his wife giving her what seemed to me about 15 minutes to prepare for this unexpected company from the moment we stepped inside the front door slipped off our shoes and were graciously greeted by a young softspoken relief society sister i sensed a spirit of order peace and love little children scurried upstairs carrying their playthings in this family of eight with seven still living at home it was clear what the family valued evidences of the lord were all aroundpictures of the savior on the wall a family photograph and picture of the temple in a prominent place copies of wellused scriptures and church videos neatly stacked on a nearby shelf the fruit of the spirit love joy peace gentleness goodness faith5 seemed to reside in that home i imagined the small room filled with children of all ages as parents sat around the low table to talk of christ to rejoice in christ to preach of christ to prophesy of christ that their children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins6 i sensed the answer the children in this home would give to the question posed by elder jeffrey r holland do our children know that we love god with all our heart and that we long to see the faceand fall at the feetof his only begotten son7 i believe the response to that question in this japanese home would be a resounding yes when a woman chooses to have christ at the center of her heart shes choosing not only to practice christlike behavior each day but also to teach her family to do the same and as you know dear sisters its in that daily business of practicing christlike behavior that we have some of our greatest challenges one mother did her best to teach the steps of repentance in her home then came the day she helped her fiveyearold son internalize the principles when she accompanied him to the store to account for a candy bar he had stolen that experience is one the boy will never forget he learned firsthand about taking responsibility for his actions with fear in his heart he returned the candy bar offered an apology to the store manager and promised never to steal again i am pleased to report that he has kept that promise i knowbecause i was the mother and my son was the fiveyearold experiences like that come into every family even when we work hard to ground our beloved children grandchildren nieces and nephews in the gospel trying to be like jesus8 does take practice which then becomes habit choosing to make christ the center of our hearts aids us in so many ways as we strive to teach others to put the lord into their hearts sometimes we feel we are not making much progress but on those discouraging days i remember the comforting words of the savior be not weary in welldoing for ye are laying the foundation of a great work9 as we choose that good part and put the savior in the center of our lives by praying daily for his guidance and help god gives us power and wisdom10 we are blessed with spiritual insights that can fortify our families when doug the father of three small children unexpectedly lost his job unemployment benefits plus their small savings and some help from the extended family were the means of his familys support his wife lori tried to be positive as they both took odd jobs to help cover their expenses they continued doing all the right thingspraying reading the scriptures attending the temple and paying tithing yet in spite of hundreds of résumés and many inquiries job interviews were few and no job offer was forthcoming one day after almost six months of job searching lori called her mother tearfully and with some anger in her voice she said i dont think heavenly father is listening to us i dont think i can pray anymore it doesnt do any good during that telephone conversation inspired words and thoughts came to loris mother as she bore her testimony and reminded her daughter of things she already knew lori you know better you know that heavenly father loves you and is aware of your needs but sometimes you have to wait perhaps this is your refiners fire i dont know but what i do know is this you need to go into your bedroom right now and kneel and pray asking the lord to comfort you and give you peace doug will find a job but it may take a while longer remember all who love you and who are praying for you and who are helping you you are very blessed what lori realized was that when she knelt down and prayedbecause she was focused on the lordshe redirected her thoughts she brought the saviors love into her own life and into her home dear sisters i have felt the love of the lord often in my life on the good days and on those days when i have felt unequal to the challenges before me i have turned to the lord for help i testify that he is always there his merciful loving arms outstretched to me and to you with all my heart i declare that jesus christ is my strength he is my hope he is my savior and redeemer with you i say as for me and my house we will serve the lord11 in the name of jesus christ amen notes 2 cor 33 gordon b hinckley
