the golden years by president boyd k packer acting president of the quorum of the twelve apostles imagepresident boyd k packer value the old folks for what they are not just what they can do years ago on christmas eve a cousin lost a little fiveyearold boy to quickpneumonia the family gathered around the casket for the family prayer a small blanket made by his mother lay folded across the little boys feet just as they were to close the casket my mother stepped forward put her arm around the grieving mother and helped her unfold the blanket and tuck it around the little boy the last his parents saw of their little son he was asleep covered with that favorite blanket it was a very tender moment that is what grandmothers do we returned to brigham city for the funeral of my wifes father william w smith a young man i knew as a seminary student stood at the casket deeply moved i did not know that he knew my fatherinlaw he said one summer i worked for him on the farm brother smith talked to me about going on a mission my family could not possibly support a missionary brother smith told me to pray about it and said if you decide to go on a mission i will pay for your mission and he did neither my wife nor her mother knew that it was one of those things that grandfathers do we have 10 children one unsettled sunday morning when our family was young my wife was in sacrament meeting as usual i was away on sunday our children took up much of a row sister walker a lovely grayhaired grandmother who raised 12 children quietly moved from several rows back and slid into the row among our restless children after the meeting my wife thanked her for the help sister walker said you have your hands full dont you my wife nodded sister walker then patted her on the hand and said your hands full now your heart full later how prophetic was her quiet comment that is what grandmothers do we presided over the new england mission one of our missionaries married and had five children he went away to get a larger car for his family and never returned his body was later found under an overpass his car had been stolen i called his stake president to offer help to the family he had already offered the grandfather said we know what our duty is we wont need any help from the church we know what our duty is that is what grandfathers do it is my purpose to speak to you about and to speak to grandparentsthe grandpas and the grandmasand to other elderly members who have no children of their own but who stand in as grandparents the scriptures tell us with the ancient is wisdom and in length of days understanding job 1212 once in a stake meeting i noticed a larger than usual number of older members most of them widows i mentioned to the stake president how impressive they were the president replied yes but they are not active in the church meaning they did not serve as leaders or teachers he spoke as though they were a burden i repeated his words not active in the church and asked are they active in the gospel he did not quite understand the difference at first like many of us he concentrated so much on what people do that he overlooked what they are a priceless resource of experience wisdom and inspiration we face an ominous challenge populations worldwide are declining the birthrate in most countries is falling and life expectancy increasing families are smallerdeliberately limited in some countries in just a few years there will be more grandparents than there are children the aging of the population has farreaching consequences economically socially and spiritually it will affect the growth of the church we must teach our youth to draw close to the elderly grandpas and grandmas the first presidency recently instructed young women approaching womanhood to join the mothers and grandmothers in relief society see first presidency letter 19 mar 2003 some young women draw away they would rather be with those their own age young women do not be so very foolish as to miss this association with the older sisters they will bring more worth into your life than much of the activity you enjoy so much leaders teach the girls to draw close to their mothers and grandmothers and to the older women in the relief society they will then have an association similar to what the young men have in the priesthood quorums all of the attention given to our youth all of the programs all we do for them will be incomplete unless we teach them the purpose of the restoration the keys of the priesthood were restored and the sealing authority revealed and temples built to tie the generations together from ancient times through all the revelations runs that eternal golden thread turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers mal 46 bishop do you realize that some problems you worry about so much with the youth and with others could be solved if they would stay close to their fathers and mothers and to their grandparents to the older folks if you are burdened with overmuch counseling there are older sisters grandmas in the ward who can influence young married women and act as a grandmother to them and there are older grandfathers for the young men older people have a steadiness a serenity that comes from experience learn to use that resource the prophet joseph smith said the way to get along in any important matter is to gather unto yourselves wise men and women experienced and aged men and women to assist in council in all times of trouble teachings of the prophet joseph smith sel joseph fielding smith 1976 299 we try to gather young people and miss getting the generations together there is so much older members can do if you see older members as inactive in the church ask yourself are they active in the gospel do not overlook a great sustaining power in the prayers of the parents and the grandparents remember the fervent prayer of a righteous man or woman availeth much james 516 alma the younger was a rebel he was struck down by an angel who told him behold the lord hath heard the prayers of his people and also the prayers of his servant alma who is thy father for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth therefore for this purpose have i come to convince thee of the power and authority of god that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith mosiah 2714 my wife and i have seen our grandparents and then our parents leave us some experiences that we first thought to be burdens or trouble have long since been reclassified as blessings my wifes father died in our home he needed constant care nurses taught our children how to care for our bedridden grandpa what they learned is of great worth to them and to us how grateful we are to have had him close to us we were repaid a thousand times over by the influence he had on our children that was a great experience for our children one i learned as a boy when grandpa packer died in our home value the old folks for what they are not just what they can do have you ever wondered why the lord organized the first presidency and the quorum of the twelve apostles so that the senior leadership of the church will always be older men this pattern of seniority values wisdom and experience over youth and physical vigor the average age of the presidency and the twelve at the present time is 77 years old we are not very nimble we may be past our prime nevertheless the lord ordered it to be this way a conference or two ago joseph wirthlin said he was going to challenge the members of the twelve to a race i thought once well ill accept the challenge then i thought it would be safer to race against 96yearold brother david haight i thought that over and decided that david might trip me with his cane and i would lose the race so i gave it up when the presidency and the twelve meet together we combine 1161 years of life with an astonishing variety of experiences and we have 430 years cumulatively as general authorities of the church almost anything we talk about one or more of us has been there done thatincluding military action we live now in troubled times in the lifetime of our youth the troubles will never be less and will certainly be more old folks offer a sure knowledge that things can be endured our children have married and left home to seek their fortune one family drove away with an old car and their little children my wife was in tears i consoled her saying the church is where they are going there will be a grandma there to answer her questions about cooking or nursing and a grandpa to teach him practical things an adopted grandma can be found in relief society and a grandpa will be found in the quorums of the priesthood but all of the grandpas and grandmas are not in the church one son bought a small home in a distant state he showed me bricks on a corner of the foundation that were eroding away he asked what should he do i did not know but i asked is there an older couple that lives close to you yes he said across the street and down a few houses is a retired couple why dont you ask him to come over and look at that he knows your climate that was done and he got the advice of an older man who had seen problems like that and many others that is what adopted grandpas can do honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee ex 2012 the apostle paul taught that aged women must teach young women and aged men must exhort young men shewing thyself a pattern of good works see titus 217 we are old now and in due time we will be summoned beyond the veil we do not resist that we try to teach the practical things we have learned over the years to those who are youngerto our family and to others we cannot do what we once did but we have become more than ever we were before lifes lessons some of them very painful qualify us to counsel to correct and even to warn our youth in your golden years there is so much to do and so much to be do not withdraw into a retirement from life into amusement that for some would be useless even selfish you may have served a mission and been released and consider yourself as having completed your service in the church but you are never released from being active in the gospel if the lord said ye have desires to serve god ye are called to the work dc 43 you may at last when old and feeble learn that the greatest mission of all is to strengthen your own family and the families of others to seal the generations now i am teaching a true principle i am teaching doctrine it is written that the principle agrees precisely with the doctrine which is commanded you in the revelation dc 1287 in the hymn how firm a foundation which was published in 1835 in the first latterday saint hymnbook we find these words een down to old age all my people shall prove my sovreign eternal unchangeable love and then when gray hair shall their temples adorn like lambs shall they still in my bosom be borne hymns no 85 v 6 keep the fire of your testimony of the restored gospel and your witness of our redeemer burning so brightly that our children can warm their hands by the fire of your faith that is what grandfathers and grandmothers are to do in the name of jesus christ amen
