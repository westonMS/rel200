did i tell you by susan w tanner young women general president imagesusan w tanner in the eternal scheme of things the most crucial and fulfilling thing you will do is to build a holy home and rear a strong family in love almost three years ago one of our daughters got married and immediately left with her husband for medical school in a distant city she was leaving the security of the nest to begin a family of her own i wondered did i teach her everything she needs to know does she know what is most important in this life is she prepared to build a happy home as i watched her drive away i remembered a little journal i gave her on her 17th birthday it was entitled did i tell you in it i recorded counsel i had often given her in our latenight conversations as she and her new husband headed for their life together i thought of three additional entries i wanted to add to that little journal to help her make a transition more important and challenging than that of crossing the country the transition to starting her own home and family let me share these entries to her and to all young people in the church to teach and testify of the importance of family first did i tell you how to make your home a haven of peace and a fortress of strength you should follow the pattern you witnessed as you entered the lords house to establish a house of prayer a house of fasting a house of faith a house of learning a house of order dc 1098 as we follow this pattern great peace will dwell within our homes in a world of increasing turmoil look to the example of your grandparents homes both sets of grandparents brought up their children in light and truth dc 9340 dads home was a house of learning he said at his fathers funeral that he had never learned a gospel principle at a church meeting that he hadnt already learned in his own home the church was a supplement to his home my home was a house of order it was of utmost importance in spite of many hectic schedules for us to be together for breakfast and dinner mealtime meant more than just refueling it was a crucial time for nourishing spirits as well as bodies small things make a happy homethings like praying saying im sorry expressing gratitude reading a good book together remember how we laughed and cried as we built the backyard fence remember how every time we drove in the car we sang so we wouldnt quarrel remember how we fasted for one members important decision and for anothers crucial test the family proclamation reiterates this successful families are established on principles of faith prayer repentance forgiveness respect love compassion work and wholesome activities the family a proclamation to the world ensign nov 1995 102 liahona oct 1998 24 in your youth you formed habits of praying and reading scriptures capitalize on those habits as well as the skills you learned of cooking and budgeting with your righteous desires and your homemaking abilities you will build a home that is a haven of peace and a fortress of strength next did i tell you that children are an heritage of the lord ps 1273 the family proclamation declares gods commandment for his children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force ensign nov 1995 102 liahona oct 1998 24 we hope heavenly father will bless you with children many in the world miss the joy and see children only as an inconvenience it is true that parenting is physically exhausting emotionally draining and mentally demanding no one will give you good grades or blue ribbons for what you do as a mother sometimes you might wonder did i do this right is it all worth it it is worth it all latterday prophets have borne witness to the sacred role of motherhood president spencer w kimball said it is important for you latterday saint women to understand that the lord holds motherhood and mothers sacred and in the highest esteem privileges and responsibilities of sisters ensign nov 1978 105 the spirit testifies to my soul that this is true you will come to know as i do that parenting is not only challenging but it provides lifes greatest joys joy comes when at family home evening a fiveyearold tells a scripture story with complete and correct details or when a child reads the book of mormon faithfully every night i feel joy when my cheerleader has the courage to tell her squad that the new cheer they are learning has inappropriate actions in it and when a missionary daughter writes of her testimony of the gospel joy comes as i watch a daughter read to a blind woman and a son serve in the temple in these moments i feel as john the beloved i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth 3 jn 14 did i tell you that to the very depths of my being i love being a mother finally did i tell you that love is the foundational virtue in building a strong home our father in heaven exemplifies the pattern we should follow he loves us teaches us is patient with us and entrusts us with our agency president hinckley said love can make the differencelove generously given in childhood and reaching through the awkward years of youth and encouragement that is quick to compliment and slow to criticize bring up a child in the way he should go ensign nov 1993 60 sometimes discipline which means to teach is confused with criticism childrenas well as people of all agesimprove behavior from love and encouragement more than from faultfinding when a young man i know had a long hippie hairstyle during his teens his parents chose to concentrate instead on his good work ethic and his kindness to needy people eventually he himself chose to cut his hair he went on to get a good education serve in the church and follow in his own family this pattern of loving children into doing what is right we demonstrate our love for family members not only in teaching them affirmatively but also in giving them of our time some time ago i read an article called putting children last which told about parents who talk about their children in appointment book terms 15 minutes at night when possible regularly scheduled play time once a week and so on see mary eberstadt wall street journal 2 may 1995 contrast that with the mother who vowed to give her children not just quality time but quantity time she recognized that a loving relationship requires constant and ongoing talking playing laughing and working moments i too believe that parents and children need to participate in each others everyday ordinary experiences so i know about your upcoming test you know about my lesson preparation i attend your games you join me in the kitchen for dinner preparation we are major players in each others lives absorbing love through daily experiences and love endures through the hardships of life the apostle paul taught charity suffereth long it beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth 1 cor 134 7 8 i watched a mothers enduring love for her alcoholic son she never gave up praying for him and being available for him in his later years he finally came to himself luke 1517 kept a respectable job and used his mechanical skills to fix up his mothers house many families struggle with wayward children we can take comfort in the eternal sealings of faithful parents which will draw children back to the fold orson f whitney in conference report apr 1929 110 we must never give up loving them praying for them and trusting in our heavenly fathers care so to my daughter and to all young people in the church as you make the transition to this new phase in your life i tell you these things i testify that in the eternal scheme of things the most crucial and fulfilling thing you will do is to build a holy home and rear a strong family in love this family unit will bless society and endure through eternity i so testify in the name of jesus christ amen
