president joseph f smith explained we can not forget them we do not cease to love them they have advanced we are advancing we are growing as they have grown5 president russell m nelson said our tears of sorrow turn to tears of anticipation6 we know about life before birth our eternal perspective not only enlarges our understanding of those who are continuing their journey beyond mortality but also opens our understanding of those who are earlier in their journey and just now entering mortality each person who comes to earth is a unique son or daughter of god7 our personal journey did not begin at birth before we were born we were together in a world of preparation where we received our first lessons in the world of spirits8 jehovah told jeremiah before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee9 some may question if life begins with the formation of an embryo or when the heart begins to beat or when the baby can live outside of the womb but for us there is no question that spirit daughters and sons of god are on their own personal journeys coming to earth to receive a body and experience mortality as covenant children of god we love honor nurture safeguard and welcome those spirits who are coming from the premortal world the amazing contribution of women for a woman having a child can be a great sacrifice physically emotionally and economically we love and honor the amazing women of this church with intelligence and wisdom you bear the burdens of your family you love you serve you sacrifice you strengthen faith minister to those in need and greatly contribute to society the sacred responsibility of safeguarding life years ago feeling deep concern for the number of abortions in the world president gordon b hinckley addressed the women of the church with words that are relevant for us today he said you who are wives and mothers are the anchors of the family you bear the children what an enormous and sacred responsibility that is what is happening to our appreciation of the sanctity of human life abortion is an evil stark and real and repugnant which is sweeping over the earth i plead with the women of this church to shun it to stand above it to stay away from those compromising situations which make it appear desirable there may be some few circumstances under which it can occur but they are extremely limited10 you are the mothers of the sons and daughters of god whose lives are sacred safeguarding them is a divinely given responsibility which cannot be lightly brushed aside11 elder marcus b nash shared with me the story of a dear 84yearold woman who during her baptismal interview acknowledged an abortion many years before with heartfelt emotion she said i have carried the burden of having aborted a child every day of my life for fortysix years nothing i did would take the pain and guilt away i was hopeless until i was taught the true gospel of jesus christ i learned how to repent and suddenly i was filled with hope i finally came to know that i could be forgiven if i truly repented of my sins12 how grateful we are for the divine gifts of repentance and forgiveness what can we do what is our responsibility as peaceful disciples of jesus christ let us live gods commandments teach them to our children and share them with others who are willing to listen13 let us share our deep feelings about the sanctity of life with those who make decisions in society they may not fully appreciate what we believe but we pray that they will more fully understand why for us these decisions go well beyond just what a person wants for his or her own life if an unanticipated child is expected let us reach out with love encouragement and when needed financial help strengthening a mother in allowing her child to be born and continue his or her journey in mortality14 the beauty of adoption in our family we have been immeasurably blessed as two decades ago a young 16yearold learned that she was expecting a child she and the babys father were not married and they could see no way forward together the young woman believed the life she was carrying was precious she gave birth to a baby girl and allowed a righteous family to adopt her as their own for bryce and jolinne she was an answer to their prayers they named her emily and taught her to trust in her heavenly father and in his son jesus christ imageemily and christian emily grew up how grateful we are that emily and our grandson christian fell in love and were married in the house of the lord emily and christian now have their own little girl imageemily with daughter emily recently wrote throughout these last nine months of pregnancy i had time to reflect on the events of my own birth i thought of my birth mother who was just 16 years old as i experienced the aches and changes that pregnancy brings i couldnt help but imagine how difficult it would have been at the young age of 16 the tears flow even now as i think of my birth mother who knew she couldnt give me the life she desired for me and unselfishly placed me for adoption i cant fathom what she might have gone through in those nine monthsbeing watched with judging eyes as her body changed the teen experiences she missed knowing that at the end of this labor of motherly love she would place her child into the arms of another i am so thankful for her selfless choice that she did not choose to use her agency in a way that would take away my own emily concludes im so thankful for heavenly fathers divine plan for my incredible parents who loved and cared for me and for temples where we can be sealed to our families for eternity15 imagephoto collage the savior took a child and set him in the midst of them and when he had taken him in his arms he said unto them whosoever shall receive one of these children in my name receiveth me16 when righteous desires are not yet realized i express my love and compassion for righteous couples who marry and are unable to have the children they so eagerly anticipate and to those women and men who have not had the opportunity to marry according to gods law the unrealized dreams of life are difficult to understand if viewed only from the perspective of mortality as the lords servant i promise you that as you are faithful to jesus christ and your covenants you will receive compensating blessings in this life and your righteous desires in the eternal time line of the lord17 there can be happiness in the journey of mortality even when all of our righteous hopes are not realized18 after birth children continue to need our help some need it desperately each year through caring bishops and your generous contributions of fast offerings and humanitarian funds the lives of millions and millions of children are blessed the first presidency recently announced an additional 20 million dollars to assist unicef in their global efforts to administer two billion vaccines19 children are loved by god the sacred decision to have a child it is concerning that even in some of the most prosperous countries of the world fewer children are being born20 gods commandment for his children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force21 when to have a child and how many children to have are private decisions to be made between a husband and wife and the lord with faith and prayer these sacred decisions can be beautiful revelatory experiences22 i share the story of the laing family of southern california sister rebecca laing writes imagelaing family in the summer of 2011 life for our family was seemingly perfect we were happily married with four childrenages 9 7 5 and 3 my pregnancies and deliveries had been high risk and we felt very blessed to have four children thinking that our family was complete in october while listening to general conference i felt an unmistakable feeling that we were to have another baby as legrand and i pondered and prayed we knew that god had a different plan for us than we had for ourselves after another difficult pregnancy and delivery we were blessed with a beautiful baby girl we named her brielle she was a miracle moments after her birth while still in the delivery room i heard the unmistakable voice of the spirit there is one more three years later another miracle mia brielle and mia are a tremendous joy for our family she concludes being open to the lords direction and following his plan for us will always bring greater happiness than relying on our own understanding23 imagebrielle and mia laing the savior loves each precious child and he took their little children one by one and blessed them and they cast their eyes towards heaven and they saw angels descending out of heaven in the midst of fire and the angels encircled those little ones about and the angels did minister unto them24 i testify that your own personal journey as a child of god did not begin for you as the first flow of earths air came rushing into your lungs and it will not end when you take your last breath of mortality may we always remember that each spirit child of god is coming to earth on his or her own personal journey25 may we welcome them safeguard them and always love them as you receive these precious children in the saviors name and help them in their eternal journey i promise

church of jesus christ of latterday saints believes in the sanctity of human life therefore the church opposes elective abortion for personal or social convenience and counsels its members not to submit to perform encourage pay for or arrange for such abortions the church allows for possible exceptions for its members when pregnancy results from rape or incest or a competent physician determines that the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy or a competent physician determines that the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth the church teaches its members that even these rare exceptions do not justify abortion automatically abortion is a most serious matter and should be considered only after the persons involved have consulted with their local church leaders and feel through personal prayer that their decision is correct the church has not favored or opposed legislative proposals or public demonstrations

to be in serious jeopardy or when the fetus is known by competent medical authority to have serious defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth but such instances are rare and there
