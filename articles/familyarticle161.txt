charity one family one home at a time by anne c pingree second counselor in the relief society general presidency imageanne c pingree as covenant women we can alter the face of the earth one family and one home at a time through charity our small and simple acts of pure love some years ago my husband and i visited the eastern sector of berlin germany chunks of what was once the infamous wall dividing the citizens of that city were lying aboutpreserved as a memorial to the triumph of freedom over bondage written on one piece of the wall in bold uneven red letters were these words many small people in many small places doing many small things can alter the face of the earth to me that phrase speaks of what each of usas covenant womencan do to make a difference as we step forward offering our hearts and hands to the lord by lifting and loving others it matters not whether we are new converts or lifelong members single married divorced or widowed whether were rich poor educated or uneducated living in a modern city or in the most remote jungle village we as covenant women have consecrated ourselves to the cause of christ through our baptismal and temple covenants we can alter the face of the earth one family and one home at a time through charity our small and simple acts of pure love charity the saviors pure love is the highest noblest strongest kind of love1 which we pray unto the father with all the energy of heart2 to possess elder dallin h oaks teaches us that charity is not an act but a condition or state of being one becomes3 our daytoday offerings of charity are written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god in the fleshy tables of our hearts4 little by little our charitable acts change our natures define our characters and ultimately make us women with the courage and commitment to say to the lord here am i send me as our exemplar the savior showed us what charity means through his own actions besides ministering to multitudes jesus demonstrated the depth of his love and care for his family even while suffering terrible agony on the cross he thought of his mother and her needs now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home5 i find it touching that this scripture shows the depth of johns devotion to mary by saying that he took her unto his own home i believe the most important acts of charity are small and simple in nature eternal in consequence and are rendered within the walls of our own homes as we try to deal patiently and lovingly every day with fussy babies challenging teenagers difficult roommates lessactive spouses or elderly disabled parents we may ask ourselves is what i am doing really important does it matter or make a difference dear sisters what you are doing with your families matters it matters so very very much daily each of us learns and relearns at home that charity the saviors pure love never faileth so many relief society sisters do great good serving in their families these faithful women do not receive the praise of the worldnor do they seek itbut of some have compassion making a difference6 who are these women who make a difference in nauvoo our early relief society sisters in the midst of grinding poverty opened their hearts and welcomed into their homes many new converts streaming into the city they shared their food their clothing and more important they shared their faith in the redeeming love of the savior in our times sister knell is a covenant woman who makes a difference she is a widow in her 80s with a 47yearold son mentally and physically disabled from birth a few years ago this dear sister set out to do what seemed impossible to everyone elseto teach her son keith to read learning to read was his greatest desire but doctors had said keith was incapable of reading with faith in her heart and a desire to bless her sons life this humble widow said to her son i know heavenly father will bless you so you can read the book of mormon sister knell wrote the following it was hard work for keith and it wasnt easy for me either at first there were some bad days because i got upset it has been a timeconsuming wordbyword struggle i sit by his side each morning i point to each word with a pencil to help him stay on track after seven long years and one month keith finally finished reading the book of mormon his mother said hearing him read a verse without help is a thrill i just cannot put into words she testifies i know miracles do happen when we put our trust in the lord7 throughout the
