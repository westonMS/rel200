the lifeline of prayer by president james e faust second counselor in the first presidency imagepresident james e faust each of us has problems that we cannot solve and weaknesses that we cannot conquer without reaching out through prayer to a higher source of strength this morning i bear witness of the importance of prayer access to our creator through our savior is surely one of the great privileges and blessings of our lives i have learned from countless personal experiences that great is the power of prayer no earthly authority can separate us from direct access to our creator there can never be a mechanical or electronic failure when we pray there is no limit on the number of times or how long we can pray each day there is no quota of how many needs we wish to pray for in each prayer we do not need to go through secretaries or make an appointment to reach the throne of grace he is reachable at any time and any place when god placed man on the earth prayer became the lifeline between mankind and god thus in adams generation men began to call upon the name of the lord1 through all generations since that time prayer has filled a very important human need each of us has problems that we cannot solve and weaknesses that we cannot conquer without reaching out through prayer to a higher source of strength that source is the god of heaven to whom we pray in the name of jesus christ2 as we pray we should think of our father in heaven as possessing all knowledge understanding love and compassion what is a prayer the savior gave us an example in the lords prayer when he prayed our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever amen3 first prayer is a humble acknowledgment that god is our father and that the lord jesus christ is our savior and redeemer second it is a sincere confession of sin and transgression and a request for forgiveness third it is recognition that we need help beyond our own ability fourth it is an opportunity to express thanksgiving and gratitude to our creator it is important that we frequently say we thank thee we acknowledge before thee we are grateful unto thee fifth it is a privilege to ask deity for specific blessings many prayers are spoken while we are on our knees the savior knelt as he prayed to the father in the garden of gethsemane4 but silent prayers of the heart also reach to heaven we sing prayer is the souls sincere desire uttered or unexpressed5 sincere prayers come from the heart indeed sincerity requires that we draw from the earnest feelings of our hearts when we pray rather than using vain repetitions or pretentious affectations such as those condemned by the savior in the parable of the pharisee and the publican6 our prayers then truly become the song of the heart and a prayer7 not only reaching god but touching the hearts of others as well jeremiah counsels us to pray with all our heart and soul8 enos recounted how his soul had hungered and that he had prayed all the day long9 prayers vary in their intensity even the savior prayed more earnestly in his hour of agony10 some are simple expressions of appreciation and requests for a continuation of blessings on our loved ones and us however in times of great personal hurt or need more may be required than mere asking the lord said you have supposed that i would give it unto you when you took no thought save it was to ask me11 blessings sought through prayer sometimes require work effort and diligence on our part for example at times fasting is appropriate as a strong evidence of our sincerity as alma testified to the people of zarahemla i have fasted and prayed many days that i might know these things of myself and now i do know of myself that they are true for the lord god hath made them manifest unto me by his holy spirit12 when we fast we humble our souls13 which brings us more in tune with god and his holy purposes we are privileged to pray daily for the small and great concerns in our lives consider the words of amulek who admonished us to pray in our fields over our flocks in our houses over our households morning midday and evening to pray against the power of our enemies and the devil to cry unto him over our crops to pour out our souls in secret and in the wilderness when we are not crying directly unto god we should let our hearts be drawn out in prayer unto him continually14 amuleks counsel in our day might be the heartfelt prayer of a wife bless jason and keep him safe as he serves our country in this time of war the prayer of a mother please bless dear jane that she will make the right choices the prayer of a father heavenly father bless johnny in his missionary labors that doors will be opened for him and that hell find the honest in heart the lisping basic prayer of a child that i wont be naughty today or that everybody will have plenty to eat or that mommy will get well soon these are sublime prayers that resound in the eternal mansions above god knows our needs better than we can state them15 but he wants us to approach him in faith to ask for blessings safety and comfort i have mentioned before an experience i had in the military in world war ii i hasten to say i was not a hero but i did my duty i endured and survived i was assigned to a british liberty ship sailing from san francisco to suez i was on that ship for 83 consecutive days except for a brief stop in auckland new zealand i was the only member of our faith on board on sundays i would go alone to the bow of the ship with my little set of servicemens scriptures and songbook amid the howling of the wind i would read the scriptures pray and sing all by myself i did not try to bargain with the lord but i did pray fervently that if i could survive the war and go home to my wife and family i would earnestly try to remain true to the sacred covenants i had made at baptism to the oath and covenant of the priesthood and to my temple vows as part of our tour of duty our little cargo ship was ordered to tow a large burnedout oil tanker into auckland new zealand the tanker had no power and was wallowing helplessly in the ocean although we never saw them we knew enemy submarines were lurking near us while we were pulling that ship we were caught in a violent storm which we later learned sank many vessels because of the load we were pulling we did not have enough power to go into the giant waves head on and our ship was thrown from side to side in the trough of the pounding seas it would creak and groan and roll from side to side almost capsizing on every roll of course i prayed as i imagine others did in time the storm moved away from us i am grateful for the sustaining influence and comfort my prayers gave me then and since in other times of peril the savior told us pray in your families unto the father always in my name that your wives and your children may be blessed16 in our day the church urges us to have family prayer every night and every morning i once heard of a primary teacher who asked a little boy if he said his prayers every night yes he replied and do you always say them in the morning too the primary teacher asked no the boy replied i aint scared in the daytime17 fear of the dark should not be our only motivation to praymorning or night family prayer is a powerful and sustaining influence during the dark days of world war ii a 500pound bomb fell outside the little home of brother patey a young father in liverpool england but the bomb did not go off his wife had died so he was rearing his five children alone he gathered them together at this very anxious time for family prayer they all prayed earnestly and when they had finished praying the children said daddy we will be all right we will be all right in our home tonight and so they went to bed imagine with that terrific bomb lying just outside the door half submerged in the ground if it had gone off it would have destroyed probably forty or fifty houses and killed two or three hundred people the next morning the whole neighborhood was removed for fortyeight hours and the bomb was finally taken away on the way back brother patey asked the foreman of the a r p squad well what did you find mr patey we got at the bomb outside of your door and found it ready to explode at any moment there was nothing wrong with it we are puzzled why it did not go off18 miraculous things happen when families pray together the savior counseled that we should pray for those who despitefully use us19 this principle is often overlooked in our prayers the prophet joseph smith understood it clearly his petitions were fervent his motives pure and the blessings of heaven regular daniel tyler an associate of the prophet recalled an important occasion at the time william smith and others rebelled against the prophet at kirtland i attended a meeting where joseph presided entering the schoolhouse a little before the meeting opened and gazing upon the man of god i perceived sadness in his countenance and tears trickling down his cheeks a few moments later a hymn was sung and he opened the meeting by prayer instead of facing the audience however he turned his back and bowed upon his knees facing the wall this i suppose was done to hide his sorrow and tears i had heard men and women prayespecially the formerfrom the most ignorant both as to letters and intellect to the most learned and eloquent but never until then had i heard a man address his maker as though he was present listening as a kind father would listen to the sorrows of a dutiful child joseph was at that time unlearned but that prayer which was to a considerable extent in behalf of those who accused him of having gone astray and fallen into sin was that the lord would forgive them and open their eyes that they might see arightthat prayer i say to my humble mind partook of the learning and eloquence of heaven there was no ostentation no raising of the voice as by enthusiasm but a plain conversational tone as a man would address a present friend it appeared to me as though in case the vail were taken away i could see the lord standing facing his humblest of all servants i had ever seen it was the crowning of all the prayers i ever heard20 as the hour of the saviors death and resurrection drew near he offered his great intercessory prayer after commending his apostles to the father and praying for them he then prayed for all those who would believe on him through their word and pleaded with the father for all of us he prayed that we could all be one as he is one with the father and that the world would believe that he was sent by the father21 no more poignant prayer was ever uttered than that given by the savior in the garden of gethsemane he withdrew from his apostles knelt and prayed father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done22 an important element of all of our prayers might well be to follow the pattern of that prayer in gethsemane not my will but thine be done by this then we acknowledge our devotion and submission to the overriding purposes of the lord in our lives as he said if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you23 what a glorious day it will be for each of us when we pray with confidence that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us24 i sincerely hope that as we say our daily prayers we remember to ask the lords blessings to continue to abide with our beloved leader president gordon b hinckley no one fully knows not even his counselors how heavy his burdens are and how great his responsibility is of this i testify in the name of jesus christ amen notes gen 426
