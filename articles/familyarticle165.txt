together to compete hoping to win as young women in the church you too are preparing and competing for a medallion as the spirit burns brightly within you the young women program can provide a wonderful training ground to help each of you reach your goals and the young women theme is a constant reminder that we are not alone in the competition we are on the lords team and he will always be there for us to help us bring home the gold as daughters of god some of you may have great athletic ability but all of you have been blessed with many talents and gifts one of the most meaningful gifts is your ability to strengthen your home and family a new phrase which has been added to the young women theme do you recognize these words one of the assignments given us as girls and women in the kingdom is to love and strengthen our families tonight it is my prayer that the spirit will burn within you that you will have a greater desire to strengthen your family now and prepare for your future family the scriptures are filled with ways to teach us how to strengthen our families there is no greater teacher than the savior as you study his teachings and follow his example you can make your family life better lets talk about three principles that will help you strengthen your home and family nurturing sacrifice prayer nurturing who doesnt enjoy playing with a small child or holding a newborn baby in their arms as women we were born with a natural ability to love and nurture others to nurture means to support each other to encourage each other to nourish and love each other are we doing this in our families the savior himself taught us to nurture many times he said how oft have i gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and have nourished you 3 ne 104 as you gather together in your family you can do so much to invite a spirit of unity when was the last time you put your arms around your mom or dad and thanked them for all they do parents do most of the nurturing but they need to be nurtured too as women we can gather our little chickens under our wings with love and tenderness recently i watched a young mother talk to her twoyearold child when she was crying and the mother couldnt understand what she wanted the mother said dont cry use your words tell me whats bothering you she had shown such respect for this twoyearold baby that the baby stopped crying and used her words this young mother is learning how to nurture when our father in heaven introduced the savior to the world he demonstrated good nurturing by using a soft voice the language of the scripture says they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven and it was not a harsh voice neither was it a loud voice notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center 3 ne 113 in our homes this can be a model for the way we talk to our family members let us not use a loud voice but a soft voice when we talk to those we love this is the way heavenly father speaks to his children sacrifice the second principle is sacrifice as young women you are learning to sacrifice every day we are so impressed with all the good things you are doing you tend after school when your mothers need to work you help fix dinner and put babies to bed you stay home from parties on weekends because you wont watch inappropriate movies regardless of the rating thousands of you get up at five oclock each morning to attend earlymorning seminary before going off to school the savior is so proud of you he knows what youre going through he understands how hard it is for you to make sacrifices the savior taught us to sacrifice he sacrificed his life for all mankind after he was resurrected the first thing he taught the nephites was how he had sacrificed he said i have drunk out of that bitter cup which the father hath given me i have suffered the will of the father in all things 3 ne 1111 he had done what heavenly father wanted him to do heavenly father wants us to create a righteous family becoming a wife and mother may limit your career opportunities but it can be so rewarding as a young mother i remember playing a song for my little girls while they danced around the room it may sound a little silly but it says it all when i grow up i want to be a mother and have a family one little two little three little babies of my own of all the jobs for me ill choose no other ill have a family and i will love them all day long and give them cookies and milk and yellow balloons and cuddle them when things go wrong and read them stories and sing them pretty tunes janeen brady i want to be a mother in beloved songs 1987 1013 well you get the idea being a mother is a great blessing not a sacrifice prayer third the savior teaches us to pray as you help strengthen your family prayer must be a consistent daily part of your life prayer will protect you from the adversary give you peace and help your families love each other more when the savior visited the nephites he had only a few days to teach them the fulness of the gospel during much of that time he focused on prayer did you know that in chapters 17 through 20 of third nephi prayer is mentioned about 44 times many times he commanded the people to pray he knelt on the ground and prayed for them he taught them how to pray he blessed the little children and prayed unto the father for them he commanded them to always pray in their hearts perhaps during a mutual activity you could bring your scriptures read those four chapters aloud and underline when the word prayer is mentionedsharing stories and testimonies on the power of prayer i promise that you will feel the spirit of the lord and develop a stronger testimony of prayer our prophets have said that they dont worry about the youth who pray twice a day now if they dont worry about us then we dont need to worry about ourselves as long as we sincerely pray twice a day listen to a wonderful story by the mother of the prophet joseph smith about the night he went to get the gold plates she writes that night i sat up very late about twelve oclock joseph came to me and asked me if i had a chest with a lock and key and not having one i was greatly alarmed but joseph said never mind i can do very well without itbe calmall is right shortly after joseph and emma left taking a horse and wagon now listen to what his mother says i spent the night in prayer and supplication to god for the anxiety of my mind would not permit me to sleep the pleadings of a mother a righteous daughter of god comforted the prophet and protected the gold plates over the years her constant prayers helped strengthen her home and family see lucy mack smith history of joseph smith ed preston nibley 1979 102 how can you use prayer to strengthen your family because heavenly father loves you so he wants you to talk to him whatever struggles you may have you can pray about anything you can pray for help in keeping family rules such as coming home on time you can pray that your family will have a desire to study the scriptures together you can pray that you will have better communication with your mom or your dad you can pray that you will be more patient with a sister or brother helping them solve their problems pray over problems that worry you dont give up heavenly father can and will answer your prayers i have had many prayers that have been answered i also have prayers that have not been answered yet our prayers will be answered in the lords time when we are ready tonight i have talked about three principles to help you strengthen your home and family nurturing sacrifice prayer the savior our redeemer and friend has shown us the way as you practice his teachings you may never win the olympic silver or gold but earning your young womanhood medallion can bring a much greater reward and help keep the fire of the holy ghost burning brightly within each one of you as you study and develop a love for the scriptures i pray that you will find other meaningful ways to strengthen your home and family in the name of jesus christ amen
