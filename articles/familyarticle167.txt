the seventh commandment a shield by elder neal a maxwell of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder neal a maxwell the keeping of the seventh commandment is such a vital shield by lowering or losing that shield the muchneeded blessings of heaven are lost with you my brothers and sisters i have appreciated afresh the prophetic ministry of president hinckley i testify that he was foreordained a long long time ago and we are glad i share the reluctance jacob expressed when he wrote of the problems of unchastity and infidelity the breaching of what some number as the seventh commandment anxious because his audience had feelings exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate jacob did not wish to enlarge the wounds of those who were already wounded instead of consoling and healing their wounds jacob 27 9 nevertheless jacobs words about the harsh consequences of immorality are diagnostic as well as poetic many hearts died pierced with deep wounds jacob 235 today we move among so many of the walking wounded and the casualty list grows hence reassuring gospel givens could rightly be stressed such as how individuals who truly repent though their sins be as scarlet may become as white as snow isa 118 but the rigors and the rich rewards of repentance are not the purposes of this talk nor is giving deserved praise to the many valiant youth and adults who practice chastity and fidelityeven when for example only a shrinking minority of american society now believes premarital relations are wrong commendations therefore to those who have faith unto obedience regarding the commandments as well as salutations to those who have faith unto repentance alma 3415 emphasis added when commandments are violated clearly unchastity and infidelity bring serious consequences such as the rippling even haunting effects of illegitimacy and fatherlessness along with disease and the shredding of families so many marriages hang by a thread or have already snapped this quiet but deep crisis coexists with vexing international crises in our time including war jesus spoke of latter days when there would be distress of nations with perplexity and how all things would be in commotion luke 2125 see also dc 8891 dc 4526 therefore the keeping of the seventh commandment is such a vital shield by lowering or losing that shield the muchneeded blessings of heaven are lost no person or nation can prosper for long without those blessings strange in a time otherwise obsessed with entitlements how little concern there is over our becoming entitled to the blessings of heaven instead a declining belief by some in ultimate immortality has only intensified proximate immorality leading away many telling them that when a man was dead that was the end thereof alma 3018 a japanese thinker looking at our pleasurecentered western society said almost confrontingly if there is nothing beyond death then what is wrong with giving oneself wholly to pleasure in the short time one has left to live the loss of faith in the other world has saddled modern western society with a fatal moral problem takeshi umehara the civilization of the forest ancient japan shows postmodernism the way in at centurys end ed nathan p gardels 1995 190 therefore being good citizens includes being good such as in knowing the clear difference between lusting after a neighbor and loving ones neighbor matthew arnold wisely observed that while nature cares nothing for chastity human nature cares about it a great deal philistinism in england and america vol 10 of the complete prose works of matthew arnold ed r h super 1974 160 to which i add divine nature cares infinitely more the influential tendencies of the natural man are unfriendly to the seventh commandment and these involve the selfdamaging carnal sensual and devilish mosiah 163 see also mosiah 319 moses 513 if these three words sound too harsh consider brothers and sisters the awful goal the adversary pursues that all men might be miserable like unto himself 2 ne 227 misery really does love company one of the best ways we can put off the natural man is to starve him mosiah 319 weakened he is more easily dislodged otherwise he insists on getting his ticket punched at every stop on the temptation train sadly corrective words do not usually help the natural man either because lust chokes the word see mark 419 unfortunately breaking the seventh commandment is made easier when clever sophists persuade some that whatsoever individuals do is really no crime alma 3017 yet some have eager ears actually itching to hear something less than the truth so they follow those who try to smooth the sharpedged inconvenient commandments see 2 tim 43 nevertheless the proverb remains true whoso committeth adultery lacketh understanding prov 632 the commandments are ignored by still others who are otherwise focused dostoevsky has one of his characters say the ages will pass and humanity will proclaim by the lips of their sages that there is no crime and therefore no sin there is only hunger fyodor mikhailovich dostoevsky the brothers karamazov trans constance garnett 1952 13031 the adversary has also artificially inflated the concept of privacy further lubricating the slide away from individual accountability after all a few mouse clicks on a computer can take one privately and quickly into enemy territory without having to go through passport control the only remaining restraint then being the checkpoint of dulled conscience but god does not have two sets of ten commandments one indoor and another outdoor nor are there two approved roads to repentance true a weekend of regret may produce some sorrowing of the damned but not the mighty change which only godly sorrow produces morm 213 mosiah 52 alma 51314 see also 2 cor 710 yes we mortals are still free to choose yes a war was even fought in heaven to preserve our moral agency yet down here the great gift of agency is often surrendered without so much as a mild whimper there are so many ways to keep the shielding seventh commandment firmly in place instructively for instance davids fall at least in part was facilitated because he was not where duty lay it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle david tarried still at jerusalem 2 sam 111 then as you know came the lustful view from the roof and all the sadness that followed implicit therefore in the instruction stand ye in holy places is to avoid indulgent tarrying dc 878 see also matt 2415 those who live after the manner of happiness 2 ne 527 also wisely develop protective spiritual manners these manners are reflected in their proper dress language humor and music thereby sending the signal of determined discipleship see prov 237 moreover the avoidance of later difficulty includes not carrying into a marriage unrepentedof sins causing spouses to start off unequally yoked together 2 cor 614 likewise husbands and wives can deliberately avoid drifting apart by refusing to relax their loyalties and by not being caught in the strong currents leading to the waterfalls equally to be avoided is the stagnant swamp of selfpity therein individuals can easily rationalize any remaining sense of accountability by pushing aside the restraints of both conscience and covenants seeking to justify themselves before men for that which is an abomination before god luke 1615 seeing through sensualitys deceptive spin is another vital preventive for instance some of those who flout the seventh commandment by their immoral lifestyles are like cains declaring i am free moses 533 after breaking the sixth commandment by slaying abel such erroneous thinking about freedom evokes peters warning words of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage 2 pet 219 see also 2 ne 22630 true strident souls may even fake laughter amid bondage and sin but another proverb applies even in laughter the heart is sorrowful and the end of that mirth is heaviness prov 1413 in an age rightly concerned with truth in advertising how intellectually insulting are certain deceptive labels ecstasy should read misery rave is really a mournful mutter emanating from sensuality gone amok for instance some participants foolishly think a little lewd dancing is harmless these individuals do not sin ignorantly 3 ne 618 by imitating and by underestimating the enemy they end up compromising themselves while confusing and disappointing their friends ever wonder why the sensual scene so often features flashing but fading lights or why all the reinforcing glitz or why all the loudness masquerading as music because fearful of the dawn evil cannot stand the steady scrutiny of bright truth nor can it endure the quiet reflections of soulsearching thus the drumbeat of desensitization deadens the tastebuds of the soul by responding illegitimately to the legitimate need for belonging and for love as predators and victims sadly become past feeling 1 ne 1745 eph 419 moro 920 henry fairlie wrote of how the lustful person will usually be found to have a terrible hollowness at the center of his life henry fairlie the seven deadly sins today 1978 187 still some naive youth talk about filling their canteens which will be empty except for the residual sand and gravel of toxic memories fairlie also wrote lust is not interested in its partners but only in the gratification of its own craving lust dies at the next dawn and when it returns in the evening to search where it may it is with its own past erased the seven deadly sins today 175 however costumed or made up lust is no substitute for love actually brothers and sisters it chokes out the development of real love causing the love of many to wax cold matt 2412 no wonder we are told to bridle all our passions that we may be filled with love alma 3812 otherwise oozing passions fill the available soul space and double occupancy is not possible previously society has often had helpful though subtle balancing and restraining mechanismsincluding families and churches and schoolsto checkrein excessive individual behavior but too often some of these mechanisms are either missing malfunctioning or equivocating moreover the foregoing trends are further accelerated by the fashionable nonjudgmentalism which excuses whatever wrong individuals doas long as they do anything else commendable after all didnt mussolini make the trains run on time violators of the seventh commandment may still make useful contributions but they pay a hidden personal cost see alma 2813 of king morianton we read he did deal justly with his people but not with himself because of his many whoredoms ether 1011 apparently a fair norespecterofpersons leader morianton did not respect himself his selfinflicted wounds were masked by the outward ornamentation of riches and buildings see ether 1012 so sobering is all of the foregoing that what follows needs to be said and i do not hesitate to say it the revelations tell us that commensurate with their own sins unrepentant sinners must suffer even as jesus did for ours as they one day personally experience the full justice of god see dc 191618 additionally however those who in various ways persistently foster and intensify this often drugdrenched drama of immoralitywhether as promoters enablers facilitators or profiteerswill also then face and then feel all the misery they have caused countless others finally brothers and sisters in certain times and circumstances discipleship requires us to be willing to stand alone our willingness to do so here and now is consistent with christs kneeling alone there and then in gethsemane in the final atoning process none were with him dc 13350 see also matt 263845 as we take our stand the faithful will not be alonenot that alone however of necessity the angel who stood by christ in gethsemane to strengthen him left him see luke 2243 if we hold aloft the shield of faith in god and faith in his commandments his angels will be round about us to bear us up and have charge over us dc 8488 dc 10922 of this promise i testify and now therefore in terms of the weather in our souls brothers and sisters i testify that we set the dial we so determine the degree of our happiness in this and the next world i likewise testify that our compliance with gods commandments including the seventh invites god to place his hand on ours as we set the dial it is the hand of him who desires to give us all that he hath see dc 8438 in the name of jesus christ amen
