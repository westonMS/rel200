through if anything is wrong i am going to need someone with me i was delighted to get a preview peek at someone i am going to love and treasure through eternity i wanted to reassure her that everything was all right but in my heart i too worried after the doctor reviewed the technicians video he came in to discuss the findings with us his first words were i wish every baby could look this perfect i could hardly contain myself as we got to our car i could not hold back my feelings any longer and i began to cry so many feelings just came spilling out i wept wishing every expectant mother

here are sacred because of their connection to our heavenly father and our heavenly home my experience with my daughter brought into clear focus once again the priority and vital importance of home and family it also reminded me that as women with natural tendencies to love nurture and teach we are called to protect and bless all who comprise our family as he sends babies to this earth the lord

family living improvement era apr 1963 252 but how do we raise righteous children in a world which increasingly resembles sodom and gomorrah president howard w hunter retold this historic story that helps me answer that question the final and decisive battle of the napoleonic wars was fought on june 18 1815 near brussels belgium in the village of waterloo what is now known as the battle of waterloo ranks as a great turning point in modern history and brought about drastic changes in political boundaries and the power balance in europe at a critical moment in this great battle between the forces of the french emperor napoleon and the allied forces under the command of the british general arthur wellesley better known as the duke of wellington an anxious officer dashed into the office of the duke with the message that unless the troops were immediately withdrawn they must yield before the larger french army the duke ordered stand firm but we shall all perish replied the officer stand firm again was the answer of the duke see howard w hunter that we might have joy 1994 148 stand firm was the dukes order victory was the result in these two words of directionstand firmi take courage and counsel today sisters we are engaged in a fierce battle for the minds hearts and even the souls of our children grandchildren and other family members but in this fight we have much more powerful weaponry and armor than did the duke of wellingtons troops for we have available to us the strength that comes from faith in the lord jesus christ and the power of the gospels ordinances to be victorious we must arm ourselves with faith in the lord jesus christ and stand firm in our convictions in the book of mormon we read of the lamanites who were converted unto the true faith and they would not depart from it for they were firm and steadfast and immovable willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the lord 3 ne 614 your strong and unwavering faith in and knowledge of the gospel of jesus christ and his plan for you and your family will be a great protection against conflicting viewpoints and evil influences your obedience and faithfulness to eternal covenants and commandments can bring peace and yes even happiness amid the chaos of this world armed with faith you can stand firm and you can create a home worthy of heavenly fathers children once while i was traveling in an area plagued by violence and social unrest a sensitive priesthood leader perceived my fear and shared with me a few words that brought comfort when he was a boy his mother finding herself suddenly single and destitute drew strength from the following words she read in an old book i said to the man who stood at the gate of the year give me a light that i may tread safely into the unknown and he replied go out into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of god that shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way minnie louise haskins in the oxford dictionary of quotations 4th ed ed angela partington 1996 328 my friends mother rebuilt her life and created a firm foundation by following this admonition i too was sustained in my time of concern by pressing forward into the unknown armed with the knowledge that the lords companionship was better than any mortal protection to stand firm we must know in the core of our souls that the lord will be our support if we stand firmly planted on the rock of our redeemer this idea is fervently expressed in the fifth chapter of helaman and now remember remember that it is upon the rock of our redeemer who is christ the son of god that ye must build your foundation that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds yea his shafts in the whirlwind yea when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you it shall have no power over you to drag you down because of the rock upon which ye are built which is a sure foundation a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall hel 512 sisters the lords promises are sure he has given his life for our salvation to maintain a firm stance for ourselves and help others stand firm the message of the restored gospel must be firmly planted in our hearts and taught in our homes in your own homes give your children and loved ones the spiritual armor they will need as they leave you each day and venture away from the safe fortress of your home teach your loved ones how to draw upon the powers of heaven through fasting and prayer teach them that keeping the sabbath day holy will insulate them from the world teach them to be obedient teach them to seek gods approval not mans teach them that the only route back to our heavenly home is by loving and following the savior and by making and keeping sacred covenants and commandments the truths of the gospel and knowledge of the plan of salvation are weapons your family members can use for victory over satans evil forces in our roles as wives mothers grandmothers sisters and aunts we must stand firm as role models because we love them we want to give our family members a strong righteous pattern to follow in everything we do and say in how we dress in how we spend our time in all the choices we make we demonstrate what we believe and that becomes their pattern to follow lucy mack smith mother of the prophet joseph smith recorded in her history that in the spring of 1803 she and her husband were much concerned about religion she writes of her own search for truth i retired to a grove not far distant where i prayed to the lord that the true gospel might be presented history of joseph smith ed preston nibley 1958 43 does that sound familiar seventeen years later in the spring of 1820 the prophet joseph smith in search of truth came to the determination to ask of god so i retired to the woods to make the attempt jsh 11314 is it a coincidence that both mother and son chose a grove of trees as the place to ask god to reveal truth to them josephs prayer blessed the entire world through the restoration of the gospel of jesus christ the righteous example set by a woman who stands firm in faith blesses countless others as much as i love being a wife and mother i acknowledge it isnt always easy i can appreciate the feelings expressed by a gradeschool girl when my friend her teacher asked the class to write letters to god sharon said dear god i bet its very hard for you to love everyone in the world there are only five people in my family and i just cant do it in like manner im certain my family members could tell you its not always easy for them to love me however i agree with elder loren c dunn who said there can be nothing more precious or enduring than the family our precious families ensign nov 1974 9 in spite of how difficult family life can be at times the work we do in our families is of the utmost importance when you are discouraged and things in your family are not going the way you wanted them to stand firm with faith and say like another young schoolgirl in her letter to god dear god im doing the very best i can dont allow the difficulties inherent in family life to unduly discourage you or to impact the love which we can share in families let us arm ourselves with faith and stand firm in our convictions let us never forget that we are building a foundation for and with our family upon the rock of our redeemer let us put our hand into gods hand with the lords help we can build homes that are a righteous fortress may the lord bless you in your efforts to stand firm in defense of home and family is my prayer in the name of jesus christ amen
