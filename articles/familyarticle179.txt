sacrifice an eternal investment by carol b thomas first counselor in the young women general presidency imagecarol b thomas sacrifice is an amazing principle it can develop within us a profound love for each other and our savior jesus christ as a mother i think one of the most heartwrenching stories in the old testament is that of abraham asked by the lord to offer his young son isaac as a sacrifice sarah must have been at least 100 years old when isaac was taken to the mountain out of kindness to her i think abraham might not have told her what he intended to do and that meant he had to bear this great test of faith alone president lorenzo snow once said no mortal man could have done what abraham did except he were inspired and had a divinity within him to receive that inspiration the teachings of lorenzo snow ed clyde j williams 1984 116 beginning with adam all old testament prophets have kept the law of sacrifice sacrifice is integral to the celestial law pointing us to the most glorious sacrifice of all our savior jesus christ president gordon b hinckley defined sacrifice so beautifully when he said without sacrifice there is no true worship of god the father gave his son and the son gave his life and we do not worship unless we givegive of our substance our time strength talent faith and testimonies teachings of gordon b hinckley 1997 565 brothers and sisters the law of sacrifice is one of the things that sets us apart from the rest of the world we are a covenant people blessed with opportunities to worship and to give but are we fully converted to the principle of sacrifice im reminded of the wealthy young man taught by the savior who asked what do i still lack in my life see matt 1920 jesus said to him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell all that thou hast and come and follow me matt 1921 lets discuss three ways that sacrifice can help us follow the savior teaching our families giving to the poor and needy and sharing ourselves in missionary work first how can we teach our families to sacrifice my grandfather isaac jacob was a great example to me grandpa was a sheep rancher who sent four sons on missions during the depression it became my mothers opportunity to serve and she received her call to canada grandpas situation became critical when he was called in by his bank and asked just what was the 50 a month going out for moms mission he had taken out a loan and was paying a high rate of 12 percent interest the bankers were not satisfied and told him to bring mom home from her mission the following day grandpa gave his answer if that girl comes home the sheep are yoursand ill bring them right up to your door this caught the bankers by surprise they were already using grandpa to care for other sheep outfits which they had acquired and they would have no one else to take care of all those sheep mom completed her mission and grandpas example taught his family the importance of sacrifice as we teach our families to sacrifice we should also teach them to deny themselves the story is told of the civil war general robert e lee who when asked by a woman for advice in raising her child said teach your child to deny himself see joseph packard recollections of a long life 1902 158 we must avoid saturating our children with material things we may deprive a child of enjoyment when we give him too much if we never allow him to want something he will never enjoy the pleasure of receiving it are we encouraging our children to sacrifice by giving their time and resources such as helping a lonely neighbor or befriending someone who needs it as they concentrate on the needs of others their own needs become less important true joy comes from sacrificing for others second we can give more generously to the poor and needy as i visit with church members i am overwhelmed with the goodness of faithful latterday saints a young man in colombia raised by his grandmother owned several shoe repair shops and served as the custodian in his ward when he was called on a mission he had saved not only enough money to pay for his own mission but also contributed extra funds to support another missionary what about sharing our food clothing and furniture the lord commands that we not covet our own property see dc 1926 in many places we are blessed to have deseret industries we can teach our children to go through their closets regularly and share their clothing while it is still in style allowing others to dress fashionably too many rewards come from sharing our material possessions king benjamin reminds us of this when he says for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day that ye may walk guiltless before god impart of your substance to the poor such as feeding the hungry clothing the naked visiting the sick and administering to their relief mosiah 426 we can all be searching for the many opportunities in our lives to giveto share the third area of sacrifice is missionary work as part of our assignment in visiting wards and branches throughout the church we see the tremendous need for senior missionaries you cant imagine what a great good they do as they love the missionaries and teach the local members the doctrine and culture of the church recently president hinckley visited a stake conference in an affluent area where only four older couples were serving missions hoping to inspire more members to serve he promised them that their children and grandchildren would not even miss them while theyre gone with the invention of email friendly letters can be sent and received by senior missionaries just about any day your years of experience will bless others and youll discover how wonderful people really are the missions of the world need you pray for that spirit of adventure and a desire to serve a mission youll enjoy more excitement than motorhome travel or rocking chairs young people we hope you are excited about missionary work just last week each young woman in the church was invited to bring one other young woman into full activity how great it would be if the young men would join us in this effort many of you are doing remarkable things megan a young woman prayed many months for two friends who were not members of the church arranging for one friend to sign up for seminary and inviting the other to be taught by the missionaries recently these two young women were baptized the church needs you president hinckley cannot walk down the halls of your school and teach your friends but you can and the lord is counting on you were so proud of the courage you have as you share your love for the gospel with your friends sacrifice is an amazing principle as we willingly give our time and talents and all that we possess it becomes one of our truest forms of worship it can develop within us a profound love for each other and our savior jesus christ through sacrifice our hearts can be changed we live closer to the spirit and have less of an appetite for things of the world president hinckley taught a grand truth when he said it is not a sacrifice to live the gospel of jesus christ it is never a sacrifice when you get back more than you give it is an investment a greater investment than any its dividends are eternal and everlasting teachings of gordon b hinckley 56768 how comforting to know that we are not expected to make this investment alone like abraham of old we have a divinity within us to receive inspiration through the powers of heaven brothers and sisters i pray that by doing these things we will come to love the principle of sacrifice that this great principle will bring us closer to our savior in the name of jesus christ amen
