plow in hope by elder neal a maxwell of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder neal a maxwell by utilizing the atonement we access the gifts of the holy ghost which filleth with hope and perfect love moro 826 granted brothers and sisters the world is in commotion but the kingdom is in forward motion as never before see dc 8891 dc 4526 its distinctiveness is being more sharply defined by adverse trends in the world where traditional values are not fastened down by the rivets of the restoration they are sliding swiftly see dc 10531 the results are contradictory mixtures such as boredom and violence some simply exist having no hope and without god in the world eph 212 see also alma 4111 the trek of modern discipleship is taking us through this hostile wilderness including cultures ambivalent about setting limits and with no brakes yes we have unprecedented mass entertainment and mass communications but so many lonely crowds the togetherness of technology is no substitute for the family much as i lament the resulting and gathering storms there can be some usefulness in them thereby we may become further tamed spiritually for except the lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions they will not remember him hel 123 the lord is always quietly refining his faithful people individually anyway but events will also illuminate gods higher ways and his kingdom see dc 13631 our context is challenging however we have many overwhelmed parents more and more marriages in meltdown and dysfunctional families destructive consequences impact steadily from drugs violence and pornography truly despair cometh of iniquity moro 1022 since the adversary desireth that all men might be miserable like unto himself his is the plan of misery 2 ne 227 see also 2 ne 218 the valiant among us keep moving forward anyway because they know the lord loves them even when they do not know the meaning of all things 1 ne 1117 as you and i observe the valiant cope successfully with severe and relentless trials we applaud and celebrate their emerging strength and goodness yet the rest of us tremble at the tuition required for the shaping of such sterling character while hoping we would not falter should similar circumstances come to us it may be too late to fix some communities but not to help those individuals and families willing to fix themselves it is not too late either for some to become pioneer disciples in their families and locations or for individuals to become local peacemakers in a world from which peace has been taken see dc 135 if still others experience a shortage of exemplars they can become such while joshua was able to say but as for me and my house some individuals presently bereft of intact families nevertheless can still say but as for me and then so live as to become worthy of all the lord has prepared for them see josh 2415 thus disciples stand fast dc 914 hold out faithful to the end dc 613 and hold on their way dc 1229 even in a troubled world however enduring and submitting are not passive responses at all but instead are actually more like being braced sufficiently to report for advanced duties while carryingmeekly and victoriouslybruises from the previous frays what are a few fingers of scorn now anyway see 1 ne 833 when the faithful can eventually know what it is like to be clasped in the arms of jesus morm 511 what are mocking words now if later we hear those glorious words well done thou good and faithful servant matt 2521 meanwhile paul urges us to plow in hope 1 cor 910 therefore desperately needed is longitudinal perspective the hope of the gospel todays putdown is then placed in the perspective of our being lifted up tomorrow in gods plan of happiness see alma 428 16 since the lord wants a people tried in all things dc 13631 how specifically will we be tried he tells us i will try the faith and the patience of my people see mosiah 2321 since faith in the timing of the lord may be tried let us learn to say not only thy will be done but patiently also thy timing be done hope feasts on the words of christ through patience and comfort of the scriptures written for our learning rom 154 and bolstered by having all these witnesses jacob 46 see also 2 ne 3120 faith constitutes the assurance of things hoped for and the proof of things not seen jst heb 111 see also ether 126 therefore whatever our humble furrow we are to plow in hope 1 cor 910 finally developing a perfect brightness of hope 2 ne 3120 see also alma 294 yet too many of the partially committed like naaman wait for the lord to bid them to do some great thing while declining his biddings in small things 2 kgs 513 when he was humbled and corrected not only did naamans flesh become like that of a little child but his heart also see 2 kgs 51415 failure to serve the master in small ways estranges us from him see mosiah 513 those however who plow in hope not only understand the law of the harvest but they also understand what growing seasons are all about true those with genuine hope may see their proximate circumstances shaken like a kaleidoscope at times yet with the eye of faith they still see divine design alma 515 ultimate hope of course is tied to jesus and the great atonement with its free gift of the universal resurrection and the proffer of gods greatest gift eternal life see moro 74041 alma 2728 dc 613 dc 147 several scriptures describe the essence of that glorious and rescuing atonement including a breathtaking autobiographical verse confiding how jesus would that i might not drink the bitter cup and shrink dc 1918 since the infinite atonement required infinite suffering the risk of recoil was there 2 ne 97 alma 3412 all humanity hung on the hinge of christs character mercifully he did not shrink but finished his preparations unto the children of men dc 1919 but christs unique submissiveness has always been in place indeed he has suffered the will of the father in all things from the beginning 3 ne 1111 keenly observing his father all the while verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise john 519 this verse carries intimations of grand thingsbeyond the beyond in the agonizing atoning process jesus let his will be swallowed up in the will of the father mosiah 157 as sovereigns choosing to yield to the highest sovereign is our highest act of choice it is the only surrender which is also a victory the putting off of the natural man makes possible the putting on of the whole armor of god which would not fully fit before see eph 611 13 redeeming jesus also poured out his soul unto death mosiah 1412 see also isa 5312 dc 384 as we on occasion pour out our souls in personal pleadings we are thus emptied making room for more joy another fundamental scripture describes jesus having trodden the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of almighty god dc 88106 see also dc 76107 dc 13350 others can and should encourage commend pray and comfort but the lifting and carrying of our individual crosses remains ours to do given the fierceness christ endured for us we cannot expect a discipleship of unruffled easiness as we seek forgiveness for example repentance can be a roughhewn regimen to bear by the way let us not as some do mistake the chips we have placed on our own shoulders for crosses uniquely atoning jesus also descended below all things in that he comprehended all things dc 886 see also dc 1228 how deep that descent into despair and abysmal agony must have been he did it to rescue us and in order to comprehend human suffering therefore let us not resent those tutoring experiences which can develop our own empathy further see alma 71112 a slothful heart will not do and neither will a resentful heart so being admitted fully to the fellowship of his sufferings requires the full dues of discipleship philip 310 see also 1 cor 19 moreover jesus not only took upon him our sins to atone for them but also our sicknesses and aching griefs see alma 71112 matt 817 hence he knows personally all that we pass through and how to extend his perfect mercyas well as how to succor us his agony was all the more astonishing in that he trod the winepress alone dc 13350 on occasion the god of heaven has wept see moses 728 one ponders therefore the agonies of jesus infinite atonement and the feelings of the fatherfor his son and for us there are no instructive relevant revelations but our finite emotional extrapolations come flooding in anyway if like the savior we do not shrink then we must go with the demanding flow of discipleship including where the tutoring doctrines of the master take us otherwise we may walk with jesus up to a point but then walk no more with him see john 666 shrinking includes stopping as well as turning back the more we know of jesus the more we will love him the more we know of jesus the more we will trust him the more we know of jesus the more we will want to be like him and to be with him by becoming the manner of men and women that he wishes us to be see 3 ne 2727 while living now after the manner of happiness 2 ne 527 therefore with the help of the holy ghost we can glorify christ by repenting and thereby accessing the blessings of the astonishing atonement which he provided for us at such a stunning cost see john 1614 so brothers and sisters given what jesus died for are we willing to live with the challenges allotted to us see alma 294 6 trembling is sometimes both permissible and understandable there are many specific ways in which we can liken to ourselves these essence scriptures about jesus and the atonement but all are covered under this conceptual canopy take my yoke upon you and learn of me matt 1129 in fact there is no other way to learn deeply see 1 ne 1923 the infinite atonement is so vast and universal but finally it is so very personal mercifully through the atonement we can be forgiven and very importantly we can know that we have been forgiventhat final joyous emancipation from error by utilizing the atonement we access the gifts of the holy ghost which filleth with hope and perfect love moro 826 none of us can afford to be without that needed hope and love in the treks through our sinais of circumstance thus within the discipleship allotted to us we are to overcome the world see 1 jn 534 to finish the work we personally have been given to do to be able to partake of a bitter cup without becoming bitter to experience pouring out our souls to let our wills increasingly be swallowed up in the will of the father to acknowledgetough though the tutoring trialsthat indeed all these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good dc 1227 and to plow enduringly to the end of the furrowall the while glorifying him and using the matchless gifts he has given us including one day all that he has dc 8438 in the holy name of jesus christ amen
