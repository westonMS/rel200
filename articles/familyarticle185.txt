it govern our lives how many of you have ever wanted to develop a new talent have you ever taken piano or soccer lessons tonight i want to talk to you about developing a talentnot just any talent but one very special talent i bet you have never even thought about i would like to talk to you about developing your talent for spirituality did you know that spirituality is a talent elder bruce r mcconkie of the quorum of the twelve apostles once said above all talents chief among all endowmentsstands the talent for spirituality the millennial messiah 1982 234 spirituality is learning how to listen to the spirit and then letting it govern our lives so how do we learn to listen to the spirit well first of all we need to understand what the spirit is second well look at young women who have learned how to recognize the spirit as members of the church we are given two spiritual gifts the light of christ given to all men at birth and the special gift of the holy ghost given after our baptism it allows us to live by the power of the holy ghost which is the power of revelation and testimony bruce r mcconkie doctrines of the restoration sermons and writings of bruce r mcconkie ed mark l mcconkie 1989 93 once we know what the spirit is how do we recognize it when we feel it thats the hardest part when i was 14 i remember realizing what the spirit was for the very first time i loved going to church especially sacrament meeting i always felt so warm and peaceful this was the spirit im not sure i knew how important it was i just knew it made me feel good as an adult ive learned that it not only makes us feel good it teaches and testifies and cleanses us from sin it can warn us of danger and help us remember things some young women struggle to identify the spirit one girl wrote i havent really had any experiences with the holy ghost and thats mostly my fault for not living like i should but im trying harder and hopefully i will have a chance soon to feel the comforting influence of the holy ghost letter on file in the young women office these feelings are normal this young woman may not know it but the holy ghost is giving her a desire to feel his influence the spirit doesnt always give us warm fuzzy feelings most of the time the voice of inspiration is a quiet voice a still small voice i remember what the savior said to the faithful nephites when he visited the new world i perceive that ye are weak that ye cannot understand all my words go into your homes ponder upon the things which i have said and ask the father that ye may understand 3 ne 1723 the saviors words were written for us its ok if were weak as long as we dont stay weak as long as we do something about it katie is a young woman who did just that let me share her story with you all my life i have wanted to be good but i got to the point where i wondered how can anyone really know if the church is true i took moronis challenge and for five months prayed and read my scriptures every day one night i sat on my bed almost in tears giving up i decided to pray i said heavenly father help me to please just know you are there ive done what thou hast asked according to the church and i just really need to know immediately i felt like someone had wrapped their arms around me i didnt hear a loud voice or see an angel but i felt heavenly father telling me sweet katie youve known all along it was like a kind and loving father comforting his little girl letter one of the main functions of the holy ghost is to testify of truth the spirit testified to katie that the gospel is true katie had paid the price as the savior said she went to her home studied his words and prayedfor five whole months katie is developing her talent for spirituality she can use this gift to govern her life talents are meant to be shared as you learn to play the piano you can bless others with your music as you develop your talent for spirituality you can use this gift to bless your family did you know you have some responsibility for the happiness in your family it isnt just your moms or dads job to keep the family happy you can help too listen to what brooke did as she shared her talent for spirituality my eightyearold sister was scared of strangers coming into the house one night she came into my room and i tried to explain to her that she wasnt hearing anyone walking around i remembered my seminary teacher challenged us to always try to have heavenly fathers spirit with us so i prayed in my heart that i would get help to not be frustrated a verse came instantly into my head i opened the scriptures and told her to read it to me then i was bearing testimony to her about the holy ghost and how if she wanted peace to get down and pray and the spirit would come she gave me a hug and kiss and went off to bed then i remembered my 10yearold sister on the top bunk she told me she never knew that if you wanted something like that you could pray and the spirit would bring you peace i know the holy ghost was inspiring me to say that letter there are lots of ways you can bless your family brooke did three important things she bore her testimony she prayed for her sister and she was an example to her other sister on the top bunk this strengthened her own spirituality as well the savior invites us to bear testimony he has said go ye into all the world preach the gospel to every creature dc 688 many of you love bearing testimony at camp well you dont have to wait for camp you can bear your testimony to your family often in simple ways when my grandchildren visited me and we saw a picture of president hinckley i said i love president hinckley i am so grateful to have a living prophet on the earth today it took about 10 seconds but it taught my grandchildren and helped us feel the spirit we bear testimony every single day by our example just last month when i was writing this talk my daughter jill came home happily fixed dinner and washed the dishes the sweet spirit she carries in her heart blesses our home i know she loves jesus by the way she shows her love for me another way we show our love for jesus is through prayer president hinckley has said let every family in this church have prayer together teachings of gordon b hinckley 1997 216 your daily conversations with him will bring peace into your hearts and a joy into your lives that can come from no other source teachings of gordon b hinckley 216 you can help your family remember to pray prayer is like an umbrella in the storms of life when i was a busy mom with seven children at home i was so grateful when one of my children would say we forgot to have family prayer sometimes we would stand by the back door and pray as the children ran off to school it always strengthened the spirituality in our home and you can pray for your family if there is contention pray for a spirit of peace no matter what heavenly father will bless you with peace in your heart prayer is a miracle it can help develop the spirituality in your home recently our prophet president hinckley prayed for the youth of the church it was a nevertobeforgotten experience can you even imagine how wonderful it would be to know that jesus prays for us when he was among the nephites he knelt upon the earth and prayed unto the father no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the father 3 ne 1715 17 could it be with you as it was with the nephite children as the savior ministered to them he did loose their tongues and they did speak great and marvelous things even greater than he had revealed unto the people 3 ne 2614 with the power of the spirit you too can speak great and marvelous things in your own family these children saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire and they came down and encircled those little ones about and the angels did minister unto them 3 ne 1724 you may never see angels descending out of heaven but i can promise you as you bear testimony and pray in your families unseen angels will minister to you as you share your talent for spirituality you will feel the warmth and power of the spirit governing your life the prophets are right you young women are part of the greatest generation we have ever had teachings of gordon b hinckley 718 you can be a strong influence on your family it is a true principle that the lord operates through families now that you have learned how the spirit works and how you as young women can use it to bless your families it is our prayer that you will let spirituality become you heavenly father is eager to unleash this great power may the spirit bless you as you develop your talent for spirituality i pray in the name of jesus christ amen
