an invitation with promise by bishop keith b mcmullin second counselor in the presiding bishopric imagebishop keith b mcmullin just being a member of this church is not enough nor is merely going through the motions of membership sufficient to those who yearn for spiritual truth some things become selfevident i bear my witness of these things god is in his heavens we mortals are his spirit offspring jesus is our redeemer joseph smith was gods prophet and gordon b hinckley is his prophet today revelations are pouring forth as in days of old the kingdom of god which is the church of jesus christ of latterday saints is once more upon the earth satan is real and is on the earth as well he and his legions are wreaking havoc among the children of men he speaks no truth feels no love promotes no good and avows nothing but mayhem and destruction therefore i raise this day a voice of warning1 it is an urgent sobering reminder and invitation to good men and women everywhere listen to these words of revelation received on november 1 1831 wherefore i the lord knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth called upon my servant joseph smith jun and spake unto him from heaven and gave him commandments for i am no respecter of persons and will that all men shall know that the day speedily cometh the hour is not yet but is nigh at hand when peace shall be taken from the earth and the devil shall have power over his own dominion2 the lord speaks of calamity to befall the inhabitants of the earth calamities come in different forms from time to time the forces of nature convulse and we are wrenched by their destructive powers even more devastating however are the calamitous forces of evil which surfeit us continually in accordance with the prophecy of 1831 peace has now been taken from the earth and the devil has power over his dominion his beguiling ways are mesmerizing the people temptation is on every hand crassness and wrangling have become a way of life what was once considered awful is now considered tame what at first titillates soon captivates and then destroys this calamity of evil will continue to spread until the whole world groaneth under the bondage of sin3 therefore this voice of warning beware of worldly lusts they stimulate the senses but enslave the soul those caught in the web of sensuality find that it is not easily broken beware of worldly wealth its promises are enticing but its happiness is a mirage wrote the apostle paul the love of money is the root of all evil4 beware of worldly preoccupation with self the highs are counterfeit the lows are despairing love kindness personal fulfillment and genuine selfworth are found in service to god and others not in service to oneself in the midst of these perils there is a safe harbor from the revelation cited earlier comes this assurance and also the lord shall have power over his saints and shall reign in their midst and shall come down in judgment upon idumea or the world5 there is safety in being a saint members of the church of jesus christ today are known as latterday saints in addition to being the lords designation of those who belong to his church this appellation also serves as his invitation to a better way of life this became clear to me some years ago when as a young father i needed to purchase some temple clothing upon entering the store my attention was drawn to a sign on the counter that read for latterday saints only the message jolted me in my mind an argument ensued why does it say for latterday saints only i asked myself why doesnt it say something like for endowed church members why does it raise this issue of being a latterday saint the years since have tempered my impetuous nature that argumentative encounter of long ago has become a treasured defining moment the experience taught me that just being a member of this church is not enough nor is merely going through the motions of membership sufficient in this day of cynicism and unbelief the spirituality and vigilance of a saint are required being saintly is to be good pure and upright for such persons virtues are not only declared but lived for latterday saints the kingdom of god or the church is not a byline rather it is the center and the substance of their lives home is a bit of heaven6 not a hotel the family is not merely a societal or biological entity it is the basic eternal unit in gods kingdom wherein the gospel of jesus christ is taught and lived indeed latterday saints diligently strive to become a little better a little kinder a little nobler in the daily affairs of life the lord sets forth the way in which such progress is made said he wherefore seek not the things of this world but seek ye first to build up the kingdom of god and to establish his righteousness7 holding to this course provides latterday saints the means for avoiding the treacherous shoals of worldliness living this way enables members of the church to become the covenant people of the lord for our time we have the following prophetic guidance from president hinckley on how this can be done i quote we are a covenant people i have had the feeling that if we could just encourage our people to live by three or four covenants everything else would take care of itself the first of these is the covenant of the sacrament in which we take upon ourselves the name of the savior and agree to keep his commandments with the promise in his covenant that he will bless us with his spirit second the covenant of tithing the promise is that he will stay the destroyer and open the windows of heaven and pour down blessings that there will not be room enough to receive them three the covenants of the temple sacrifice the willingness to sacrifice for this the lords workand inherent in that law of sacrifice is the very essence of the atonement consecration which is associated with it a willingness to give everything if need be to help in the onrolling of this great work and a covenant of love and loyalty one to another in the bonds of marriage fidelity chastity morality if our people could only learn to live by these covenants everything else would take care of itself i am satisfied8 worldly lusts lose their allure as the holy sacrament assumes its proper place in our lives this covenant enables the faithful to keep themselves unspotted from the world9 worldly wealth loses its peril through conscientious adherence to the lords tithe returning to him a tithe of all he provides engenders in the giver a love of god above all else it introduces the obedient to the higher law of giving without command the fast and fast offerings are embraced and power comes to loose the bands of wickedness lift heavy burdens bless the less fortunate and strengthen family ties10 the covenant of tithing weans the faithful from the love of money and its attendant trappings worldly preoccupation with self surrenders to sacrifice consecration and the other holy covenants of the temple as the redeemer of the world gave all that we might be saved these covenants allow us to give our all in the accomplishment of heavenly fathers purposes for his children and so fear not the things deemed weak by the world overthrow evils that appear so mighty and strong righteous men speak in the name of god the lord faith increases in the earth the everlasting covenants blossom in the lives of latterday saints the fulness of christs gospel is proclaimed by precept and example unto the ends of the world and the lords covenant people prepare this earth for his second coming11 this is our duty may the lord sustain us in it is my prayer in the name of jesus christ amen notes dc 14 dc 117 35 dc 8449 1 tim 610 dc 136 david o mckay in
