the tugs and pulls of the world by elder neal a maxwell of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder neal a maxwell many individuals preoccupied by the cares of the world are not necessarily in transgression but they certainly are in diversion and thus waste the days of their probation 2 ne 927 for true believers the tugs and pulls of the worldincluding its pleasures power praise money and preeminencehave always been there now however many oncehelpful support systems are bent or broken furthermore the harmful things of the world are marketed by pervasive technology and hyped by a media barrage potentially reaching almost every home and hamlet all this when many are already tuned out of spiritual things saying i am rich increased with goods and have need of nothing rev 317 contrastingly the perks of discipleship are such that if we see a stretch limousine pulling up we know it is not calling for us gods plan is not the plan of pleasure it is the plan of happiness the tugs and pulls of the world are powerful worldly lifestyles are cleverly reinforced by the rationalization everybody is doing it thus fanning or feigning a majority products are promoted and attitudes engendered by clever niche marketing peter counseled of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage 2 pet 219 brothers and sisters there are so many personalized prisons scoffers display the shouldershrugging attitude foretold by peter where is the promise of christs coming for all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation 2 pet 34 such cynicism mistakes the successive casts on the mortal stage for the absence of a director or a script like goldfish in a bowl some are mindless of who changes the water and puts in the pellets see jacob 41314 or like a kindergarten child whose retrieving parent seems a little late concluding man is alone in the universe granted some sincerely wish for more power in order to do good but only a few individuals are good enough to be powerful but craving power and the spotlight sucks out the spiritual oxygen leaving some past feeling see eph 419 1 ne 1745 moro 920 strangely though desensitized some are still able to hear the beckoning click of a tv camera at a hundred yards doesnt the churning over the places of mortal power remind us of the childhood game of musical chairs actually discipleship may keep the honors of the world from us as balak told balaam i thought to promote thee unto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from honour num 241112 the rouge of recognition is so easily smeared anyway we wince as we watch those once flattered by the world like judas being used despised and discarded see dc 12120 nevertheless when some of these are ready even their hands need to be lifted up see heb 1212 dc 815 thus while granting the deserved role of commendation and praise we must not forget the words of jesus about the recipients of mortal honors they have their reward matt 62 5 there is an underlying reason brothers and sisters for all this fleetingness those who bestow the transitory things of the world are themselves transients they cannot confer that which is lasting because they do not possess it some so sensing and seeing so little want to have it all now such lamentations as the foregoing lead to several specific suggestions to begin with no remedy is more powerful than accessingmore than we dothe gifts of the holy ghost let us likewise honor the special place of the family as james q wilson wrote we learn to cope with the people of this world because we learn to cope with the members of our family those who flee the family flee the world bereft of the familys affection tutelage and challenges they are unprepared for the worlds tests judgments and demands the moral sense 1993 163 how ironical that some go into a far country luke 1513 leaving the nourishing family gardenin which there may be some weedsand go into a desert with its tumbling sagebrush personal righteousness worship prayer and scripture study are so crucial in order to put off the natural man mosiah 319 be wary therefore when some demand public tolerance for whatever their private indulgences are whether young or old we need to be good friends but also to pick our friends carefully by choosing the lord first choosing ones friends becomes easier and much safer consider the contrasting friendships in the city of enoch compared to peers in the cities of sodom and gomorrah the citizens of the city of enoch chose jesus and a way of life then became everlasting friends so much depends on whom and what we seek first we can also emulate the spiritual reflexes of joseph in egypt when he was tempted he fled gen 3912 showing both courage and good legs youth and adults must get out of circumstances and situations which threaten the returning prodigals are never numerous enough but regularly some come back from a far country luke 1513 of course it is better if we are humbled because of the word rather than being compelled by circumstances yet the latter may do see alma 321314 famine can induce spiritual hunger like the prodigal son we too can go to a far country which may be no further away than a vile rock concert the distance to a far country is not to be measured by miles but by how far our hearts and minds are from jesus see mosiah 513 fidelity not geography really determines the distance even with all of the worlds powerful tugs and pulls spiritual feelings can and do assert themselves anyway doubts of doubt can intrude all the quick fixes do not really cure the emptiness and boredom of secularism further some who laboriously scale the secular heights find after all that they are only squatting atop a small mound of sand they have worked so hard to get there but why covet wealth anyway if we only spend money for that which is of no worth and which cannot satisfy 2 ne 951 like jesus we can decide daily or instantly to give no heed to temptation see dc 2022 we can respond to irritation with a smile instead of scowl or by giving warm praise instead of icy indifference by our being understanding instead of abrupt others in turn may decide to hold on a little longer rather than to give way love patience and meekness can be just as contagious as rudeness and crudeness we can also allow for redemptive turbulence individually and generally see 2 ne 2819 hearts set so much upon the things of the world may have to be broken see dc 12135 preoccupied minds far from him may be jolted by a heads up see mosiah 513 many individuals preoccupied by the cares of the world are not necessarily in transgression but they certainly are in diversion and thus waste the days of their probation 2 ne 927 yet some proudly live without god in the world alma 4111 with gates and doors locked from the inside mark it down brothers and sisters people too caught up in themselves will inevitably let other people down let us adopt the attitude recommended by president brigham young say to the fields flocks herds gold silver goods chattels tenements possessions and to all the world stand aside get away from my thoughts for i am going up to worship the lord deseret news 5 jan 1854 2 there are so many ways to say to the world stand aside periodically husbands and wives can reason together taking inventory minor corrections may be needed and besides such conversations can be more precious than we know alas so many couples are too busy moments are the molecules that make up eternity years ago president hinckley counseled it is not so much the major events as the small daytoday decisions that map the course of our living our lives are in reality the sum total of our seemingly unimportant decisions and of our capacity to live by those decisions caesar circus or christ brigham young university speeches of the year 26 oct 1965 3 mercifully our errors can soon be swallowed up by resilient repentance showing the faith to try againwhether in a task or in a relationship such resilience is really an affirmation of our true identities spirit sons and daughters of god need not be permanently put down when lifted up by jesus atonement christs infinite atonement thus applies to our finite failures hence the pleading of that special hymn prone to wander lord i feel it prone to leave the god i love heres my heart o take and seal it seal it for thy courts above come thou fount of every blessing hymns 1948 no 70 it also helps in resisting the tugs and pulls of the world if we though imperfect know that currently the course of our life is generally acceptable to the lord see lectures on faith 1985 67 with sufficient dedication those quiet assurances can come the validation of our worth really comes from knowing who we are not solely from what we do jesus searching words remain what manner of men and women ought ye to be verily i say unto you even as i am 3 ne 2727 see also matt 548 3 ne 1248 of course worthwhile doing enhances our character and capacity but mortal circumstances and opportunities differ so greatly but amid these differences we can still become more like christ in our capacity to bemore loving meek patient and submissive by paying more attention to what we are rather than exclusively to what we do our public and our private persons will be the samethe man or the woman of christ our intrinsic value is not dependent upon mortal acclaim anyway in fact the world may actually see us as weak and foolish see 1 cor 127 countering however are divine affirmations including this one the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god rom 816 god is infinitely more interested in our having a place in his kingdom than with our spot on a mortal organizational chart we may brood over our personal span of control but he is concerned with our capacity for selfcontrol father wants us to come home bringing our real résumés ourselves even so our mortal jealousies still occur regularly over money turf a slight or the robes and the fatted calf given to others see luke 152223 true belonging occurs when we know who we are and to whom we really belong remember the popular lines in fiddler on the roof about anatevka there everyone knows who he is and what god expects him to do joseph stein fiddler on the roof 1964 3 emphasis added to which might be added and what god expects him to be yes we are free to choose the mortal perks with their short shelf life however ahead lies that great moment when every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that jesus is the christ see mosiah 2731 dc 88104 then the galleries and the mortal thrones will be empty even the great and spacious building will falland resoundingly see 1 ne 82628 then too those who have lived without god in the world will confess that god is god see mosiah 2731 meanwhile his character and attributes should evoke adoration and emulation from us isnt it marvelous brothers and sisters that god who knows everything still spends time listening to our prayers compared to that cosmic fact what does the world really have to offer us one round of applause one fleeting moment of adulation or an approving glance from a phantom caesar may god bless us to see things as they really are and as they really will be see jacob 413 dc 9324 and may we give the glory and honor and praise unto god which i now do in the holy name of jesus christ amen
