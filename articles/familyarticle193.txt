stand tall and stand together by sheri l dew second counselor in the relief society general presidency imagesheri l dew no woman is a more vibrant instrument in the hands of the lord than a woman of god who is thrilled to be who she is by the time i turned 12 i was a 5foot 10inch social disaster towering over my friends was the bane of my adolescence i didnt want to stand outat least not that wayso i compensated by slouching as a result mother was constantly urging me to stand up straight well i didnt want to stand up straight then but i do now for we have all been admonished to stand up 2 ne 817 and to stand as a witness see mosiah 189 so that we may stand blameless before god at the last day dc 42 i can find absolutely no scriptural injunction to slouch in zion instead we are repeatedly told to get on our feet to arise and stand up 3 ne 202 as a teenager i did not realize that blending in with the crowd would never be my lot nor is it yours for as women of god we must stand tall so that we will stand out from the rest of the world only in doing so may we hope to find joy for finding joy and standing tall not in feet or inches but as ambassadors for the lord are directly connected my family has been reminded of this recently in a very poignant way i have 17 nieces and nephews who are a pure delight we have hiked and biked and fasted and prayed together and recently we have cried together a few weeks ago we suffered a crushing loss when an accident took the lives of two of my sisters childrenamanda who was 11 and tanner who was 15 because we have lived together in love we have truly wept for the loss of them that died see dc 4245 our friends in our hometown wept with us most of them nonmembers and we knew their hearts might never be more open to truth than on the day two caskets rested in our little kansas chapel so we dedicated the funeral entirely to testifying of christ and the restored gospel afterwards many told us how moved they were by what they heard and by what they felt some have even asked to learn more now we dont know if anyone affected by our childrens deaths will join the church but this we do knowthat standing up for what we believe and teaching the gospel to friends who had never before been willing to listen helped soothe our pain and bring us joy as a family in this world the only true joy comes from the gospelthe joy that radiates from the atonement and from ordinances that transcend the veil and from the comforter that salves our souls recently my 11yearold niece aubrey whose father died five years ago was asked by a nonmember friend why she wasnt sad about the deaths of her father and recently her cousins aubreys reply was classic not sad trust me we are sad but we know that we will be together again so we dont worry as much as a family weve no doubt cried as much but we dont worry as we would if we hadnt felt the transcendent reach and healing power of jesus christ the gospel is beauty for ashes isa 613 it is the oil of gladness heb 19 it is such good news though our children are gone for now we have the glorious reassurance that we havent lost them but what about our fathers children our brothers and sisters who are lost and who face not only physical but spiritual death the gospel of jesus christ is all about people its about leaving the ninety and nine and going into the wilderness after those who are lost its about bearing one anothers burdens with the ultimate burden anyone can bear being walking through this life without light hence the lords latterday plea the field is white already to harvest and it is the eleventh hour and the last time that i shall call laborers into my vineyard wherefore thrust in your sickles and reap with all your might dc 333 7 ancient prophets foresaw a day when the knowledge of a savior would spread throughout every nation kindred tongue and people mosiah 320 that day has come and it is our turn to thrust in our sickles and help with the harvest that we are here now is no accident for aeons of time our father watched us and knew he could trust us when so much would be at stake we have been held in reserve for this very hour we need to understand not just who we are but who we have always been for we are women of god and the work of women of god has always been to help build the kingdom of god when in premortality we accepted our fathers plan said elder john a widtsoe we agreed right then and there to be saviors for the whole human family the working out of the plan became not merely the fathers work and the saviors work but also our work utah genealogical and historical magazine oct 1934 189 then when we were baptized here we renewed our commitment toand our covenant withthe lord no wonder president gordon b hinckley has declared that if the world is going to be saved we have to do it no other people in the history of the world have received a more compelling mandate than we have and wed better be getting at it church is really doing well church news 3 july 1999 3 sisters we have work to do the prophet joseph charged the relief society with the work of saving souls see history of the church 525 for it is our very nature to nurture and to search after those who are lost and yet president spencer w kimball lamented that there was a power in relief society that had not yet been fully exercised to build the kingdom of god relief societyits promise and potential ensign mar 1976 4 for all the good it has done in the past relief society has yet to help move this latterday work forward as it must sisters the time has come to unleash the power of righteous happiness that exists among women of god the time has come for us to be anxiously engaged in the work of saving souls the time has come for the sisters of relief society to stand with and for the prophet in helping build the kingdom the time has come for us each to stand tall and to stand together standing tall begins with our own conversion for when we taste the gospels exceeding joy alma 3624 we want to share it the casseroles and quilts we have made to relieve suffering are splendid acts of kindness but no servicei repeat no servicecompares with that of leading someone to christ do you want to be happy i mean really happy then nurture someone along the path that leads to the temple and to christ the most effective way to share the gospel is to live it when we live like disciples of christ should live when we arent just good but happy to be good others will be drawn to us because we are distinct and differentin happy ways as president kimball prophesied the role of righteous women ensign nov 1979 104 happy about the way weve chosen to live happy because were not constantly reshaping ourselves in the worlds image happy because we have the gift and the power of the holy ghost 1 ne 1337 happy to stand tall so that we will stand out every time we strengthen our own testimony or help someone else strengthen theirs we build the kingdom of god every time we mentor a newly baptized sister or befriend a wandering soul without judging her or invite a nonmember family to home evening or give a book of mormon to a colleague or lead a family to the temple or stand up for modesty and motherhood or invite the missionaries into our homes or help someone discover the power of the word we build the kingdom of god imagine how it lifted my sisters spirits when she read this journal entry tanner had made just before he died thanks mom and dad for teaching me about christ what builds the kingdom more than raising up a child to the lord with the exception of those serving fulltime missions we neednt don name badges or knock on doors to help build the kingdom for though some would portray us as dowdy and dominated rather than the dynamic radiant women we are no woman is more persuasive no woman has greater influence for good no woman is a more vibrant instrument in the hands of the lord than a woman of god who is thrilled to be who she is i like to think of us as the lords secret weapon if we did have name tags i would want mine to read sheri dew woman of god busy building the kingdom of god imagine what would happen in this church if every morning 45 million of us got on our knees and asked our father who he needed us to reach out to that day and then imagine if we did it imagine if we consecrated our energy and our focus en masse to the greatest service of all that of leading our sisters and brothers to christ imagine what will happen when we mobilize the sisters of relief society to stand together to help build the kingdom we will see the awakening and arising of a sleeping slouching giant tonight i invite you to stand tall to thrust in your sickle and join in this work with vigor i invite you to rededicate your life to building the kingdom to reach out to someone who has wandered to take a new member under your wing to consider serving a mission with your husband to look and pray for missionary moments to make a difference in someones life spiritually especially the members of your own family none of us have to reach everyone but what if we all reached someone and then someone else and so on president hinckley has asked us to become a vast army with enthusiasm for this work find the lambs feed the sheep ensign may 1999 110 as we do so we will become one of the mightiest forces for good this world has ever seen for we the sisters of relief society are women of god and the work of women of god and the work of the relief society has always been to help build the kingdom of god i believe that we can do more to help our priesthood leaders than we have ever done before in my nephews priesthood quorum just a few hours before he died tanner said this you know if i were to die soon i would want my funeral to be a missionary farewell my prayer tonight is that we can be equally clear about our mission as women of god this isnt just a really nice church that teaches really nice ideas so that we can live really nice lives this is the church of jesus christ of latterday saints endowed with his power and charged with carrying his truth to the ends of the earth i love our father and i love his son and i have come to know for myself that this is their work and their glory and that we are the most blessed of all women to have such a vital part in it may we lift our voices as with the sound of a trump dc 426 may we find joy as we stand tall and stand together and may we cheerfully do all things that lie in our power dc 12317 and then stand still to see the arm of god revealed as his work goes forward boldly and nobly until it has swept every country and sounded in every ear till the purposes of god shall be accomplished and the great jehovah shall say the work is done history of the church 4540 in the sacred and holy name of jesus christ amen
