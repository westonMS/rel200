gladness lord we praise thy holy name in this sacred place of worship we thy glories loud proclaim bright and clear our voices ring singing songs of exultation to our maker lord and king1 charles c rich on april 7 1863 spoke of the need for a tabernacle in which to meet he declared what shall i say in regard to the tabernacle we can see at once that we can enjoy the blessings of such a house at the present time if we put it off when will it be built when that house is built we can then enjoy the benefits and blessings which it will afford the same principle may be applied to everything we take in hand and with which we have to do whether it be to build a temple a tabernacle to send teams to the frontiers to gather the poor or do any other work that is required of us nothing that is required will be performed until we go to work and do something ourselves we have no other people to lean upon and therefore it remains for us to go to work and perform well our part2 they went to work thanks be to god for our noble prophet president gordon b hinckley who with the foresight of a seer recognized the need for this magnificent facility and with the help of many others went to work the result is before us today and will be dedicated this morning as a symbol of our gratitude as an expression of our love for the lord could we not rededicate our lives and our homes in a like manner the apostle paul in his epistle to the corinthians added an apostolic dimension to our building commitment when he declared know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you3 the need for personal dedication and recommitment is essential in todays society just a hurried glance at several newspaper stories describes our plight from the associated press came the following in the name of free speech the supreme court struck down a federal law that shielded children from sexoriented cable tv channels4 from the san jose mercury news came this story germany may be the economic engine of europe but on sundays it stops but global market forces are beginning to disturb germanys traditional day of rest with americanstyle 7dayaweek shopping already being offered and the internet providing 24hour access to the worlds goods such rigid store regulations are like a castle from the old century to vie with other worldclass cities berlin must be more aggressive we want to make more money5 as we view the disillusionment that engulfs countless thousands today we are learning the hard way what an ancient prophet wrote out for us 3000 years ago he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase6 the revered abraham lincoln accurately described our plight we have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of heaven we have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity we have grown in numbers wealth and power but we have forgotten god we have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us and we have vainly imagined in the deceitfulness of our hearts that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own intoxicated with unbroken success we have become too selfsufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace too proud to pray to the god that made us7 when the seas of life are stormy a wise mariner seeks a port of peace the family as we have traditionally known it is such a refuge of safety the home is the basis of a righteous life and no other instrumentality can take its place or fulfil its essential functions8 actually a home is much more than a house a house is built of lumber brick and stone a home is made of love sacrifice and respect a house can be a home and a home can be a heaven when it shelters a family when true values and basic virtues undergird the families of society hope will conquer despair and faith will triumph over doubt such values when learned and lived in our families will be as welcome rain to parched soil love will be engendered loyalty to ones best self will be enhanced and those virtues of character integrity and goodness will be fostered the family must hold its preeminent place in our way of life because its the only possible base upon which a society of responsible human beings has ever found it practicable to build for the future and maintain the values they cherish in the present happy homes come in a variety of appearances some feature families with father mother brothers and sisters living together in a spirit of love others consist of a single parent with one or two children while other homes have but one occupant there are however identifying features which are to be found in a happy home whatever the number or description of its family members these identifying features are a pattern of prayer a library of learning a legacy of love on this the american continent jacob the brother of nephi declared look unto god with firmness of mind and pray unto him with exceeding faith9 a prominent judge was asked what we as citizens of the countries of the world could do to reduce crime and disobedience to law and to bring peace and contentment into our lives and into our nations he thoughtfully replied i would suggest a return to the oldfashioned practice of family prayer concerning making our personal lives and our homes libraries of learning the lord counseled seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom seek learning even by study and also by faith10 the standard works offer the library of learning of which i speak we must be careful not to underestimate the capacity of children to read and to understand the word of god as parents we should remember that our lives may be the book from the family library which the children most treasure are our examples worthy of emulation do we live in such a way that a son or a daughter may say i want to follow my dad or i want to be like my mother unlike the book on the library shelf the covers of which shield its contents our lives cannot be closed parents we truly are an open book in the library of learning of our homes next do we exemplify the legacy of love do our homes bernadine healy in a commencement address gave this counsel as a physician who has been deeply privileged to share the most profound moments of peoples lives including their final moments let me tell you a secret people facing death dont think about what degrees they have earned what positions they have held or how much wealth they have accumulated at the end what really matters is who you loved and who loved you that circle of love is everything and is a great measure of a past life it is the gift of greatest worth11 our lord and saviors message was one of love it can be as a light to our personal pathway to exaltation near the end of his life one father looked back on how he had spent his time on earth an acclaimed respected author of numerous scholarly works he said i wish i had written one less book and taken my children fishing more often time passes quickly many parents say that it seems like yesterday that their children were born now those children are grown perhaps with children of their own where did the years go they ask we cannot call back time that is past we cannot stop time that now is and we cannot experience the future in our present state time is a gift a treasure not to be put aside for the future but to be used wisely in the present have we cultivated a spirit of love in our homes observed president david o mckay a true mormon home is one in which if christ should chance to enter he would be pleased to linger and to rest12 what are we doing to ensure that our homes meet this description do we ourselves meet it on the journey along the pathway of life there are casualties some depart from the road markers which lead to life eternal only to discover that the detour chosen ultimately leads to a dead end indifference carelessness selfishness and sin all take their costly toll in human lives there are those who for unexplained reasons march to the sound of a different drummer later to learn they have followed the pied piper of sorrow and suffering today there goes forth from this pulpit an invitation to people throughout the world come from your wandering way weary traveler come to the gospel of jesus christ come to that heavenly haven called home here you will discover the truth here you will learn the reality of the godhead the comfort of the plan of salvation the sanctity of the marriage covenant the power of personal prayer come home from our youth many of us may remember the story of a very young boy who was abducted from his parents and his home and taken to a village situated far away under these conditions the small boy grew to young manhood without a knowledge of his actual parents or earthly home but where was home to be found where were his mother and father to be discovered oh if only he could remember even their names his task would be less hopeless desperately he sought to recall even a glimpse of his childhood like a flash of inspiration he remembered the sound of a bell which from the tower atop the village church pealed its welcome each sabbath morning from village to village the young man wandered ever listening for that familiar bell to chime some bells were similar others far different from the sound he remembered at length the weary young man stood one sunday morning before a church of a typical town he listened carefully as the bell began to peal the sound was familiar it was unlike any other he had heard save that bell which pealed in the memory of his childhood days yes it was the same bell its ring was true his eyes filled with tears his heart rejoiced in gladness his soul overflowed with gratitude the young man dropped to his knees looked upward beyond the bell towereven toward heavenand in a prayer of gratitude whispered thanks be to god im home like the peal of a remembered bell will be the truth of the gospel of jesus christ to the soul of him who earnestly seeks many of you have traveled long in a personal quest for that which rings true the church of jesus christ of latterday saints sends forth to you an earnest appeal open your doors to the missionaries open your minds to the word of god open
