womanhood the highest place of honor by president james e faust second counselor in the first presidency imagepresident james e faust i promise you dear young sisters that if you live the standards of personal worthiness contained in the young women program great will be your happiness and endless will be your joy to be in the presence of all you special young ladies your leaders and all others is a joy for me we are especially honored this evening to have president gordon b hinckley president thomas s monson and the other general authorities with us i commend sister nadauld sister thomas and sister larsen for their excellent messages the music by this choir of young women has been outstanding we appreciate those who have participated in the video and the hundreds who have written to the general young women presidency about how they can stand as witnesses of god at all times and in all places the many beehive and mia maid girls in this audience remind me of this little anecdote written by a sister who was preparing for a young women activity she said my 5yearold daughter asked me how many honeyhives i had after a little discussion i determined she was talking about beehives i counted the young women who were beehives and told her she had made a paper airplane for each young woman and proceeded to count out the appropriate number of airplanes when she was finished she still had a few paper airplanes left after a moment of thought she asked how many mermaids do you have1 many years ago during the time of president heber j grant the first presidency wrote the true spirit of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints gives to woman the highest place of honor in human life to maintain and to merit this high dignity she must possess those virtues which have always and which will ever demand the respect and love of mankind because a beautiful and chaste woman is the perfect workmanship of god2 to occupy the highest place of honor places a responsibility on young women to stand as witnesses of god at all times and in all places one of humankinds greatest blessings is for righteous womanhood to hold the highest place of honor in human life and to be the perfect workmanship of god i love to hear my wife ruth and our daughters say i am glad i am a woman this tells me they have the vision of their divine destiny hopefully you will find joy in your womanhood during all stages of your life as we look to the future it is interesting to look to the past in 1916 every female over age 14 was a beehive girl until she entered relief society there were no mia maids or laurels a beehive girl had a possible 374 requirements to earn her individual award some of them were care successfully for a hive of bees for one season and know their habits now that would be a challenge not to get stung cover 25 miles on snowshoes on any six days now that would be hard to do in florida during two weeks keep the house free from flies or destroy at least 25 flies daily without help or advice care for and harness a team at least five times and drive 50 miles during one season one time as a barefoot boy i was putting a harness on a horse and he stepped on my toe the last one i would mention is clear sagebrush etc off of onehalf acre of land3 i have helped clear sagebrush it can be a hot miserable task because you have to burn the sagebrush but the smoke smells good to me in 1916 the challenges of life involved an entirely different focus such as killing flies clearing sagebrush and learning to harness horses today such physical needs are met much more easily flipping on a switch to control the light adjusting the thermostat for heat and for cold modern conveniences grant us more free time to focus on spiritual needs and devote more time to personal service but the basic element which should never change in the lives of righteous young women is giving service to others their divine role as caregivers helps noble womanhood gain the highest place of honor in human life serving others can begin at almost any age often the greatest service to others is oneonone it need not be on a grand scale and it is noblest within the family i have reread the current personal progress requirements they are high standards and indicate the superb direction you young sisters receive from your church leaders i promise you dear young sisters that if you live the standards of personal worthiness contained in the young women program great will be your happiness and endless will be your joy in the movie my fair lady professor higgins poses the question why cant a woman be more like a man what a terrible mistake that would be the opportunities for you young sisters in todays world are endless the recognition of the special gifts of women has been slow in coming the womans exponent of 1872 reported that some who would improve womens status are so radical in their extreme theories that they would set her in antagonism to man assume for her a separate and opposing existence and to show how entirely independent she should be would make her adopt the more reprehensible phases of character which men present and which should be shunned or improved by them instead of being copied by women4 i wonder if you sisters fully understand the greatness of your gifts and talents and how all of you can achieve the highest place of honor in the church and in the world one of your unique precious and sublime gifts is your femininity with its natural grace goodness and divinity femininity is not just lipstick stylish hairdos and trendy clothes it is the divine adornment of humanity it finds expression in your qualities of your capacity to love your spirituality delicacy radiance sensitivity creativity charm graciousness gentleness dignity and quiet strength it is manifest differently in each girl or woman but each of you possesses it femininity is part of your inner beauty one of your particular gifts is your feminine intuition do not limit yourselves as you seek to know the will of our heavenly father in your life and become more spiritual you will be far more attractive even irresistible you can use your smiling loveliness to bless those you love and all you meet and spread great joy femininity is part of the godgiven divinity within each of you it is your incomparable power and influence to do good you can through your supernal gifts bless the lives of children women and men be proud of your womanhood enhance it use it to serve others unfortunately we see some very poor role models of womanhood in todays society we see women boxers and wrestlers as we flip through the television channels trying to find something uplifting i believe the women of our time need to be strong but not in that sense in my opinion these activities demean the nobility of womanhood young women need to be strong in righteousness and to quote your current theme to stand as witnesses of god at all times and in all things and in all places5 let me tell you of one young woman who has demonstrated remarkable strength in the face of great tragedy on april 17 1999 a big van broadsided a car and severely injured 16yearold emily jensen her skull was fractured and she was in a coma for three months and six months in the hospital she has had to learn everything again as if from birth it would have been easy to give up but giving up is not in emilys vocabulary she works so hard at recovery that she runs the equivalent of a 26mile marathon every day her faith courage and perseverance have strengthened and motivated many other hospital patients emily is still working very hard to regain her speech even so she fearlessly asks nurses technicians and therapists are you a mormon if they reply no she tells them in her muddled sentences you should be read the book of mormon emily dictated to her mother what she wanted written in five copies of the book of mormon that she gave to a doctor three therapists and a technician before she left the hospital emily dearly loved one technician who had become totally inactive in the church they prayed together in emilys hospital room in language that was difficult to understand but with a spirit that was strong and clear emily told her that she needed to go back to church that technician later wrote emily i want to thank you so much for the book of mormon you gave me i cried when i read what you wrote i know someday i will love this book as much as you do emilys life was recently brightened at skyline high school in salt lake city the student body picked her as this years prom queen in recognition of her extraordinary courage her classmates stood and cheered as she struggled to the stage of the packed auditorium supported on the arm of the student body president though she continues to go each day for therapy emilys life is still defined by her spiritual identity her goodness her kindness to others and her strong testimony6 we wonder what the young women requirements for personal progress awards will be like in the year 2016 hopefully the values and standards of young women will be increasingly focused on spirituality and service to others in the future as in the past women will find happiness and fulfillment as they respond to the deepest feelings of their souls as ralph waldo emerson said what lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us we will all have peace in our hearts and a knowledge of our true identity when we know as tevye said in fiddler on the roof who we are and what god expects us to be you young women should have personal goals in addition to the excellent goals outlined in the young women program these goals among others should include education and skill training a young mother whom i love recently told a group of young women that the goals should coincide with the joys of womanhood but she said the goals should not be so rigid and fixed that you do not listen to the whisperings of the spirit keep your hearts and minds open to know the overriding will of the lord in your lives standing as a witness means many things it encompasses the way we act how we speak and how we dress when you are considering a young man as a companion you would do well to follow the advice given some years ago by president david o mckay he must never attempt to take advantage of you if he shows any inclination to use you as a convenience or as a means of gratification then you may be sure he is not prompted by love7 it is very natural for young men and women to be attracted to each other but they should be attracted in godgiven ways rather than questionable ways such as immodest dress godgiven attractions include your innate beauty charm decency and goodness when strong young priesthood holders see a girl immodestly dressed most will not want to date her because her standards are not consistent with their eternal perspective immodesty in women cheapens their image it causes embarrassment and loss of respect it is not likely to win them the hand of a worthy honorable young man who desires to marry a righteous young woman in the temple you young ladies may have a hard time buying a modest prom dress may i suggest that you make your own you may need some help but plenty of help is available my dear young sisters your future is bright it can exceed your fondest dreams and expectations not everything that happens in your life will be as you have hoped and have planned but if you live so as to know the lords will you will find peace in your soul and great happiness you will be among those who will enjoy the highest place of honor in human life i pray that the lord will bless each of you that you can come to know your individual worth and understand why a beautiful and chaste woman is the perfect workmanship of god in the name of jesus christ amen notes traci rane on the bright side church news 30 jan 1999 improvement era may 1935 276 martha a tingey
