the creation by elder russell m nelson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder russell m nelson grand as it is planet earth is part of something even granderthat great plan of god simply summarized the earth was created that families might be we will long remember this inspiring conference in the new conference center not long ago there was only a deep hole in the ground where this building now stands we have watched its construction with interest and awe the process of construction is truly inspiring to me from conception to completion any major building project reflects upon the work of the master creator in fact the creationof planet earth and of life upon itundergirds all other creative capability any manmade creation is possible only because of our divine creator the people who design and build are given life and capacity by that creator and all materials used in the construction of an edifice are ultimately derived from the rich resources of the earth the lord declared the earth is full and there is enough and to spare yea i prepared all things1 it is difficult for mortal minds to comprehend the majesty of the creation it is much easier for us to think about good things to eat or fun things to do but i would like to stretch our minds to think of things beyond our easy grasp the creation of man and woman was wondrous and great2 so was the creation of the earth as their mortal dwelling place the entire creation was planned by god a council in heaven was once convened in which we participated3 there our heavenly father announced his divine plan4 it is also called the plan of happiness5 the plan of salvation6 the plan of redemption7 the plan of restoration8 the plan of mercy9 the plan of deliverance10 and the everlasting gospel11 the purpose of the plan is to provide opportunity for the spirit children of god to progress toward an eternal exaltation components of the plan the plan required the creation and that in turn required both the fall and the atonement these are the three fundamental components of the plan the creation of a paradisiacal planet came from god12 mortality and death came into the world through the fall of adam13 immortality and the possibility of eternal life were provided by the atonement of jesus christ14 the creation the fall and the atonement were planned long before the actual work of the creation began while visiting the british museum in london one day i read a most unusual book it is not scripture it is an english translation of an ancient egyptian manuscript from it i quote a dialogue between the father and the son referring to his father jehovahthe premortal lordsays he took the clay from the hand of the angel and made adam according to our image and likeness and he left him lying for forty days and forty nights without putting breath into him and he heaved sighs over him daily saying if i put breath into this man he must suffer many pains and i said unto my father put breath into him i will be an advocate for him and my father said unto me if i put breath into him my beloved son thou wilt be obliged to go down into the world and to suffer many pains for him before thou shalt have redeemed him and made him to come back to his primal state and i said unto my father put breath into him i will be his advocate and i will go down into the world and will fulfil thy command15 although this text is not scripture it reaffirms scriptures that teach of the deep and compassionate love of the father for the son and of the son for usattesting that jesus volunteered willingly to be our savior and redeemer16 the lord god declared this is my work and my gloryto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man17 he who under direction of the father had created the earth subsequently came into mortality to do the will of his father18 and to fulfill all prophecies of the atonement19 his atonement would redeem every soul from the penalties of personal transgression on conditions that he set20 phases of the creation each phase of the creation was well planned before it was accomplished scripture tells us that the lord god created all things spiritually before they were naturally upon the face of the earth21 the physical creation itself was staged through ordered periods of time in genesis22 and moses23 those periods are called days but in the book of abraham each period is referred to as a time24 whether termed a day a time or an age each phase was a period between two identifiable eventsa division of eternity25 period one included the creation of atmospheric heavens and physical earth culminating in the emergence of light from darkness26 in period two the waters were divided between the surface of the earth and its atmospheric heavens provision was made for clouds and rain to give life to all that would later dwell upon the earth27 in period three plant life began the earth was organized to bring forth grass herbs trees and vegetationeach growing from its own seed28 period four was a time of further development lights in the expanse of the heaven were organized so there could be seasons and other means of measuring time during this period the sun the moon the stars and the earth were placed in proper relationship to one another29 the sun with its vast stores of hydrogen was to serve as a giant furnace to provide light and heat for the earth and life upon it30 in period five fish fowl and every living creature were added31 they were made fruitful and able to multiplyin the sea and on the eartheach after its own kind32 in the sixth period creation of life continued the beasts of the earth were made after their kind cattle after their kind and everything which creepeth upon the earthagain after its own kind33 then the gods counseled together and said let us go down and form man in our image after our likeness so the gods went down to organize man in their own image in the image of the gods to form they him male and female to form they them34 thus adam and eve were formed35 and they were blessed to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth36 the seventh period was designated as a time of rest37 the creation testifies of a creator i testify that the earth and all life upon it are of divine origin the creation did not happen by chance it did not come ex nihilo out of nothing and human minds and hands able to build buildings or create computers are not accidental it is god who made us and not we ourselves we are his people38 the creation itself testifies of a creator we cannot disregard the divine in the creation without our grateful awareness of gods hand in the creation we would be just as oblivious to our provider as are goldfish swimming in a bowl with deep gratitude we echo the words of the psalmist who said o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches39 purpose and destiny of the earth this earth is but one of many creations over which god presides worlds without number have i created he said and i also created them for mine own purpose and by the son i created them which is mine only begotten40 grand as it is planet earth is part of something even granderthat great plan of god simply summarized the earth was created that families might be scripture explains that a husband and wife shall be one flesh and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation41 and as part of the planned destiny of the earth and its inhabitants here our kindred dead are also to be redeemed42 families are to be sealed together for all eternity43 a welding link is to be forged between the fathers and the children in our time a whole complete and perfect union of all dispensations keys and powers is to be welded together44 for these sacred purposes holy temples now dot the earth though our understanding of the creation is limited we know enough to appreciate its supernal significance and that store of knowledge will be augmented in the future scripture declares in that day when the lord shall come again he shall reveal all things things which have passed and hidden things which no man knew things of the earth by which it was made and the purpose and the end thereof things most precious things that are above and things that are beneath things that are in the earth and upon the earth and in heaven45 yes further light and knowledge will come the lord said if there be bounds set to the heavens or to the seas or to the dry land or to the sun moon or stars all the times of their revolutions all the appointed days months and years and all their glories laws and set times shall be revealed in the days of the dispensation of the fulness of times46 eventually the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory47 at the second coming of the lord the earth will be changed once again it will be returned to its paradisiacal state and be made new there will be a new heaven and a new earth48 our responsibilities meanwhile brothers and sisters we should understand our significant responsibilities both the creations of god and the creations of man teach us the importance of each component do you think that the absence of one piece of granite from the face of this building would be noticed of course it would so it is with each son or daughter of god we cannot let the head say unto the feet it has no need of the feet for without the feet how shall the body be able to stand49 just as the body has need of every member50 so the family has need of every member all members of a family are to be linked sealed and edified together that the system may be kept perfect51 the creation great as it is is not an end in itself but a means to an end we come to the earth for a brief period of time endure our tests and trials and prepare to move onward and upward to a glorious homecoming52 our thoughts and deeds while here will surely be more purposeful if we understand gods plan and are thankful for and obedient to his commandments53 as beneficiaries of the divine creation what shall we do we should care for the earth be wise stewards over it and preserve it for future generations54 and we are to love and care for one another55 we are to be creators in our own rightbuilders of an individual faith in god faith in the lord jesus christ and faith in his church we are to build families and be sealed in holy temples we are to build the church and kingdom of god upon the earth56 we are to prepare for our own divine destinyglory immortality and eternal lives57 these supernal blessings can all be ours through our faithfulness i testify that god lives jesus is the christ and creator he is lord over all the earth he has established his church in these latter days to accomplish his divine purposes joseph smith is the great prophet of the restoration president gordon b hinckley is his prophet today whom i sustain with all my heart in the name of jesus christ amen notes dc 10417 see
