honoring the priesthood by bishop h david burton presiding bishop imagebishop h david burton priesthood isnt something we take off during the week and put on for sunday it is a 247 privilege and blessingthat is 24 hours a day 7 days a week good evening brethren for months we have worried about this buildings readiness for general conference a miracle has been accomplisheda miracle made possible because professionals as well as common gardenvariety men and women have displayed uncommon devotion sacrifice and inspiration far beyond normal industry standards i express deep appreciation to my counselors and to all individuals who have shared their talents on this project ive been in this building many times during its construction but as i see it filled with priesthood holders tonight i marvel at its size and beauty for you who follow international soccer football the distance from where i stand to the very last row of the balcony is about threefourths the length of one field the distance is the equivalent of three basketball courts placed end to end or nearly four tennis courts fashioned in the same manner a golfer would probably select a nine iron to hit the ball over the last balcony row and a worldclass sprinter could run the distance in about nine seconds to use a word i often hear it is awesome on occasion i enjoy participating in or viewing sporting events my wife suggests the time between occasions is too short in many sports if a participant or coach places the outstretched fingers of one hand in a perpendicular position to the palm of his other hand it is a signal for timeout the contest is temporarily halted while coaches and players discuss strategy the term timeout is also used by some parents to describe to their children a state in which they will be placed if they continue on a course contrary to their parents wishes timeout offers a person a chance to think about their behavior my aaronic priesthood colleagues lets place ourselves in timeout this evening to discuss a few priesthood issues several weeks ago i was talking with my 16yearold granddaughter i asked her what she would tell the young men of the aaronic priesthood if she could speak to them she said grandpa i would ask them to show respect for the priesthood and to be priesthood holders seven days a week rather than just one day sunday some guys do not show respect for the priesthood because they use profanity some are involved in pornography and a few are into drugs im certain my young brethren that youll agree that profanity pornography and drugs should not be a part of the life of a priesthood holder the priesthood isnt something we take off during the week and put on for sunday it is a 247 privilege and blessingthat is 24 hours a day 7 days a week profanity and crudeness have become commonplace and are accepted by many as a normal part of their speech our sense of right and wrong has been dimmed by a constant bombardment of profanity and crudeness it is rampant in music schools sports shopping malls and in our workplaces much everyday conversation is laced with crude terms and sprinkled with outright profane expressions sometimes under the guise of humor recently i was in a department store trying on shoes four young men were looking at what they labeled missionary shoes it was evident at least two of the young men had received mission calls and were there to find shoes suitable for missionary service i was surprised by a barrage of crude terms with a few profanities which seemed to routinely roll off their tongues when they noticed there was someone else nearby i heard one say hey guys we better clean up our language as he motioned with his head in my direction president hinckley has said conversation is the substance of friendly social activity it can be happy it can be light it can be earnest it can be funny but it must not be salty or uncouth or foul if one is in sincerity a believer in christ teachings of gordon b hinckley 1997 494 profanity and priesthood are not compatible neither is profanity compatible with missionary service profane and crude terms if part of our conversation need to be eliminated from our vocabularies conversation is one of the windows to our souls during timeout lets talk about pornography in recent years pornography has spread like wildfire we are exposed to it daily pornography is as addictive as many substances we would not even consider taking into our bodies the consequences of pornography are catastrophic keep in mind satan does not want us to be happy or successful in our aaronic priesthood ministry make no mistake he wants us to be miserable his goal is to capture our hearts by enticing us to participate in terrible things such as pornography stay away from it we must discipline ourselves to avoid books magazines music pictures videos dvds movies internet sites television programminganything that contains pornography or sensual material pornography and priesthood are not compatible respect the priesthood call a permanent timeout to any pornographic influence president hinckley has reminded us that the modern drug scourge has become as a plague on the world in most cases it follows a long period spent in misery and pain and regret unlike the plagues of old from which there was no known defense the defense is clear and relatively easy in the case of illicit drugs it lies in simply refraining from touching them the scourge of illicit drugs in speaking out on moral issues 1992 127 we would not place our lives in jeopardy by playing with a venomous snake drugs are just as dangerous as the reptiles deadly venom our son returned to his home recently to find his son was sitting at the kitchen table with elbows on the table and his chin in his hands another son exhibited a sad countenance as he sat in the living room staring out the window their mom was not visible our son asked the boys where she might be they pointed to the bathroom he quietly knocked on the door and asked honey are you in there she replied ive put myself in timeout adults need an occasional timeout melchizedek priesthood holders please join us in timeout in the battle of daily living it is easy to lose focus on our ministries as fathers and priesthood holders if we are not careful our vocations hobbies recreation and even perhaps our church service can adversely impact our responsibility as fathers and husbands president howard w hunter had only one opportunity to address a general conference priesthood meeting while he was president of the church on that occasion october 1994 president hunter entitled his talk being a righteous husband and father in that masterful address he outlined a number of standards and expectations for all who hold the melchizedek priesthood i commend the entire address for your review tonight i mention just two president hunter said a man who holds the priesthood regards the family as ordained of god your leadership of the family is your most important and sacred responsibility the family is the most important unit in time and in eternity and as such transcends every other interest in life in conference report oct 1994 68 or ensign nov 1994 50 president harold b lee said the most important of the lords work you and i will ever do will be within the walls of our own homes stand ye in holy places 1974 255 we need to honestly search and plumb the depths of our souls are we doing all we should do to give our families gospel instruction and governance or are we leaving this responsibility to others leadership in the family often requires us to reorder our priorities in order to find the necessary time quality and quantity time are essential president hunter also reminded us a man who holds the priesthood leads his family in church participation so they will know the gospel and be under the protection of the covenants and ordinances in conference report oct 1994 69 or ensign nov 1994 51 for us to accomplish this we must make certain our personal lives are in order hypocrisy has never worked and it will not work today we are required to lead out in righteousness and encourage our families to follow our examples lead out in family home evening lead out in scripture study provide priesthood blessings lead out in personal and family prayer president monson said remember that a man never stands taller than when he is upon his knees in conference report apr 1964 130 a timeout usually concludes with a little pep talk brethren we can prevail and ultimately win the contest we can honor and respect the priesthood on a sevendayaweek 24houraday basis we can banish profanity pornography and drugs from our lives as well as any other unwholesome or unclean activity we can provide our families with the priesthood leadership and the spiritual direction they require we can do all this and much more if we will draw near to the savior honor the sacred priesthood we hold and be faithful to the covenants we have made i testify we are on the lords errand he is our savior he is our redeemer he has atoned for our sins he is our advocate with the father he lives he loves us unconditionally we are bearers of his priesthood i love president hinckley his counselors the twelve and my fellow general authorities and i testify of their goodness their greatness and their authority i love you my fellow holders of the priesthood and pray for our success in the holy name of jesus christ amen
