responded to his voice we were total strangers but the lord placed one of his precious daughters quietly next to me i was praying earnestly that the spirit of the lord would touch her and speak to her how can you and i share the beautiful message of the lord jesus christ first cultivate an awareness bring others to a knowledge president gordon b hinckley teaches us let there be cultivated an awareness in every members heart of his or her own potential for bringing others to a knowledge of the truth let him pray with great earnestness about it let each member pray9 president hinckley quotes the testimony of alma o lord wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee behold o lord their souls are precious give unto us o lord power and wisdom that we may bring these our brethren unto thee10 in the lds bible dictionary it states the object of prayer is not to change the will of god but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that god is already willing to grant but that are made conditional on our asking for them11 second a good example is our best tool president hinckley taught us the most effective tract we will carry will be the goodness of our own lives12 as we live the gospel we will be like a lighthouse on a hilltop13 the light and the salt of the earth14 we can partake of the love of god the tree of life and drink from the fountain of living waters15 daily by communing with our holy father immersing ourselves in the scriptures and meditation then the lord will bless us to be more sensitive to speak to those souls which he has prepared for us third act at a time when you feel the spirit elder m russell ballard taught us the key to success in bringing souls unto christ is to act at a time when you feel the spirit and you sense that your friend does also through our faith our trust in the lord and our good works we can bring many souls unto the lord16 as we seek and pray in faith17 the lord will guide us and his elect will soon embrace18 the glad tidings of great joy19 to partake of the eternal and infinite atonement20 of the lord jesus christ found the savior the missionaries taught patti three weeks
