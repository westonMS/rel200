we are women of god by sheri l dew second counselor in the relief society general presidency imagesheri l dew coming unto christ means walking away from the world it means placing christ and christ only at the center of our lives recently a professional assignment required me to travel out of the country but i felt such a foreboding about the trip that prior to leaving i sought a priesthood blessing i was warned that the adversary would attempt to thwart my mission and that physical and spiritual danger lay ahead i was also counseled that this was not to be a sightseeing or a shopping trip and that if i would focus on my assignments and seek the direction of the spirit i would return safely home well the warning was sobering but as i proceeded pleading for direction and protection each step of the way i realized that my experience wasnt all that unique might not our father have said to you and to me as we left his presence the adversary will attempt to thwart your mission and you will face spiritual and physical danger but if you will focus on your assignments if you will heed my voice and if you will refuse to reduce mortality to a sightseeing or a shopping trip you will return safely home the adversary is delighted when we act like sightseers meaning those who are hearers rather than doers of the word see james 122 or shoppers meaning those preoccupied with the vain things of this world that suffocate our spirits satan baits us with perishable pleasures and preoccupationsour bank accounts our wardrobes even our waistlinesfor he knows that where our treasure is there will our hearts be also see matt 621 unfortunately it is easy to let the blinding glare of the adversarys enticements distract us from the light of christ for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul matt 1626 prophets have admonished us to forsake the world and turn our hearts to jesus christ who promised us in this world your joy is not full but in me your joy is full dc 10136 emphasis added said president spencer w kimball if we insist on spending all our time and resources building up a worldly kingdom that is exactly what we will inherit the false gods we worship ensign june 1976 6 how often are we so focused on pursuing the socalled good life that we lose sight of eternal life it is the fatal spiritual equivalent of selling our birthright for a mess of pottage the lord revealed the remedy for such spiritual disaster when he counseled emma smith to lay aside the things of this world and seek for the things of a better dc 2510 and christ provided the pattern declaring prior to gethsemane i have overcome the world john 1633 emphasis added the only way that we may overcome the world is by coming unto christ and coming unto christ means walking away from the world it means placing christ and christ only at the center of our lives so that the vanities and philosophies of men lose their addictive appeal satan is the god of babylon or this world christ is the god of israel and his atonement gives us power to overcome the world if you expect glory intelligence and endless lives said president joseph f smith let the world go teachings of presidents of the church joseph f smith 1998 243 emphasis added as sisters in zion we can be obstacles to the adversarys conspiracy against families and virtue no wonder he tempts us to settle for earthly pleasures rather than to seek for eternal glory a 45yearold mother of six told me recently that when she stopped poring over magazines that plagued her with images of how her home and wardrobe should look she began to feel more at peace she said i may be chubby gray and wrinkled but i am a chubby gray wrinkled daughter of god who knows me and loves me relief society can help us turn away from the world for its express purpose is to help sisters and their families come unto christ in that spirit i join sister smoot and sister jensen in declaring who we are and in rejoicing in the announced refinements in relief societys focus we no longer have the luxury of spending our energy on anything that does not lead us and our families to christ that is the litmus test for relief society as well as for our lives in the days ahead a casual commitment to christ will not carry us through as a young girl i saw commitment in my grandmother who helped grandpa homestead our farm on the kansas prairie somehow they outlasted the dust bowl the depression and the tornadoes that terrorize the great plains ive often wondered how grandma put up with years of meager income and hard work and how she went on when her oldest son died in a tragic accident grandmas life wasnt easy but do you know what i remember most about her her total joy in the gospel she was never happier than when she was working on family history or teaching with her scriptures in hand grandma had laid aside the things of this world to seek for the things of a better to the world my grandma was ordinary but to me she represents the unsung heroines of this century who lived up to their premortal promises and left a foundation of faith upon which we may build grandma wasnt perfect but she was a woman of god now it is for you and for me to carry forward the banner into the next century we are not women of the world we are women of god and women of god will be among the greatest heroines of the 21st century as president joseph f smith proclaimed it is not for us to be led by the women of the world it is for us to lead the women of the world in everything that is praiseworthy teachings 184 this is not to diminish the lives of countless good women throughout the world but we are unique we are unique because of our covenants our spiritual privileges and the responsibilities attached to both we are endowed with power and gifted with the holy ghost we have a living prophet to guide us ordinances that bind us to the lord and to each other and the power of the priesthood in our midst we understand where we stand in the great plan of happiness and we know that god is our father and that his son is our unfailing advocate with these privileges comes great responsibility for unto whom much is given much is required dc 823 and at times the demands of discipleship are heavy but shouldnt we expect the journey towards eternal glory to stretch us we sometimes rationalize our preoccupation with this world and our casual attempts to grow spiritually by trying to console each other with the notion that living the gospel really shouldnt require all that much of us the lords standard of behavior will always be more demanding than the worlds but then the lords rewards are infinitely more gloriousincluding true joy peace and salvation how then do we as women of god fill the full measure of our creation the lord rewards them that diligently seek him heb 116 we seek him not only by studying and searching by pleading and praying and watching always lest we enter into temptation but by giving up worldly indulgences that straddle the line between god and mammon otherwise we risk being called but not chosen because our hearts are set so much upon the things of this world dc 12135 consider the principle taught in the sequence of this scriptural injunction thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy might mind and strength dc 595 emphasis added what the lord requires first is our hearts imagine how our choices would be affected if we loved the savior above all else how we would spend our time and money or dress on a hot summer day or respond to the call to visit teach and take care of one another or react to media that offend the spirit it is by letting the world go and coming unto christ that we increasingly live as women of god we were born for eternal glory just as faithful men were foreordained to hold the priesthood we were foreordained to be women of god we are women of faith virtue vision and charity who rejoice in motherhood and in womanhood and in the family we are not panicked about perfection but we are working to become more pure and we know that in the strength of the lord we can do all righteous things because we have immersed ourselves in his gospel see alma 2612 i repeat we cannot be women of the world for we are latterday women of god as president kimball taught no greater recognition can come to us in this world than to be known as women of god the role of righteous women ensign nov 1979 102 this summer i had an unforgettable experience in the holy land as i sat on the mount of beatitudes overlooking the sea of galilee i saw in the distance a city built on a hill the visual image of a city that cannot be hid was stunning and as i pondered the symbolism i had an overwhelming impression that we as women of god are like that city that if we will leave behind the things of the world and come unto christ so that the spirit radiates through our lives and from our eyes our uniqueness will be a light unto the world as sisters of relief society we belong to the most significant community of women on this side of the veil we are a spectacular city on a hill and the less we look and act like the women of the world the more they will look to us as a wellspring of hope peace virtue and joy twenty years ago at this very meeting president kimball made a statement we have quoted ever since much of the major growth that is coming to the church in the last days will happen to the degree that the women of the church reflect righteousness and articulateness in their lives and to the degree that they are seen as distinct and differentin happy waysfrom the women of the world ensign nov 1979 1034 emphasis added we can no longer be content to just quote president kimball we are the sisters who must and will make his prophecy a reality but we can do it i know we can president gordon b hinckley said recently that the eternal salvation of the world rests upon the shoulders of this church no other people in the history of the world have received a more compelling mandate and wed better be getting at it church is really doing well church news 3 july 1999 3 women of god that includes us tonight i invite each of us to identify at least one thing we can do to come out of the world and come closer to christ and then next month another and then another sisters this is a call to arms its a call to action a call to arise a call to arm ourselves with power and with righteousness a call to rely on the arm of the lord rather than the arm of flesh a call to arise and shine forth that our light may be a standard for the nations dc 1155 a call to live as women of god so that we and our families may return safely home we have such cause to rejoice for the gospel of jesus christ is the voice of gladness it is because the savior overcame the world that we may overcome it is because he rose on the third day that we may arise as women of god may we lay aside the things of this world and seek for the things of a better may we commit this very hour to come out of the world and to never look back in the name of jesus christ amen
