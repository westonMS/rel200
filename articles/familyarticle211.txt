performed its mission the family will still be functioning strengthening the family improvement era dec 1970 46 i would like to talk about building homes where each of us individuallywhether married or single young or oldcan grow and reach our ultimate potential where family members can learn all they need to know to follow the plan of salvation which is our heavenly fathers plan for each of us to find our way back to him and to our heavenly home when this probationary period of mortality is finished i echo the fervor of president david o mckay who said with all my heart i believe the best place to prepare for eternal life is in the home blueprint for family living improvement era apr 1963 252 and yet the scriptures warn that there must be an opposition in all things see 2 ne 211 indeed president boyd k packer tells us the ultimate purpose of the adversary is to disrupt disturb and to destroy the home and the family the father and the family ensign may 1994 19 this past spring two different bird families built nests in my yard a small sparrow chose a rose tree on my patio for her nest time after time she flew back and forth carrying blades of grass and small twigs in her beak carefully she manipulated her way through the rose thorns depositing her building materials in the chosen spot she worked without resting until the tiny nest was finished i was amazed at how carefully the grasses were woven to make a strong and stable structure i was almost moved to tears when i saw in the bottom of the nest four small pieces of cotton placed in just the right spot to make a soft bed for her little ones the second bird a robin chose to build her nest in front of my house near the rain gutter up high where ground predators could not reach it since she was larger so was her nest and in addition to being bigger the outside of her nest was glued with mud which kept the grasses and twigs together and held it in the crook of the rain gutter inside single blades of grass were woven into a soft cuplike shape that perfectly cradled the bird when the nests were completed both birds laid their eggs and began the daily vigil of protecting and nurturing hour after hour day after day these birds sat on their eggs after the eggs hatched the mothers worked full time to feed their hungry babies one particularly hot day i noticed the robin sitting on her nest panting with her beak open obviously she was uncomfortable in the glare of the sun i wondered why she stayed then i realized she was not sitting deep in the nest as she had when she was keeping her babies warm instead she was carefully stretched over the top of the nest forming a protective shelter to keep her featherless babies from being sunburned i began to read about birds and the great pains they take to build homes for their families did you know that barn swallows make more than 1200 mudcarrying trips in order to construct their nests one single nest of a hooded oriole was found to contain 3387 separate pieces of material it seems to me that birds invest everythingtheir time their energy their means their own comfortto make a home and rear their young it is not a priority that is given second place or avoided it takes first place since watching the birds in my yard i have wondered who taught these birds what to do how did they know how to build a nest and to shade their fledglings from the sun birds follow instincts to provide protect and nurture these are godgiven instincts and pondering on them caused me along with the psalmist to exclaim o lord how great are thy works ps 925 we are also blessed with godgiven instincts we instinctively want so much for those we love and yet being human we encounter many more problems than the birds i observed in todays society there are many who challenge the importance of the traditional home and family some think there are other uses of a womans time and talents that are more important than the family but prophets have been relentless in declaring that the role of homemaker is one of the most sacred and meaningful pursuits possible to man or woman sisters in all life circumstances have opportunities to build and nurture others within their sphere of influence as you and i learn more about heavenly fathers plan of salvation we are assured that no matter the circumstances of our individual lives creating a safe and nurturing environment for those we love is of the utmost importance elder neal a maxwell said the home is usually the place where most of our faith is established and increased how sad therefore that some homes are merely a pit stop when they should be a prep school for the celestial kingdom lord increase our faith 1994 117 as we fight the negative influences of the world and struggle to build homes that are a prep school for the celestial kingdom let us remember that our earthly activities have a spiritual base and a celestial conclusion as a relief society general presidency we want to reaffirm our goals and commitment to the purpose of relief society which is to help sisters and their families come to christ we want to make certain that relief society is a help and blessing to every sister in the church regardless of her circumstances we are eager for each sister to strengthen herself spiritually and to acquire skills that will be crucial in meeting the challenges that are ahead therefore with the approval of the first presidency and the quorum of the twelve apostles we are pleased to make the following announcements effective january 1 2000 the name of homemaking meeting will be changed the new name will be home family and personal enrichment the purpose of the new name is to clearly communicate what this important midweek meeting of relief society is designed to accomplish the further purpose of the new name is to help each of us refocus our attention on strengthening ourselves and then with that increased strength build our family members friends neighbors and community so that each may be brought closer to our heavenly father and his son jesus christ during the 15minute lesson portion of this meeting teachers will present a spiritual topic during the 60 to 90minute activity portion we will learn practical skills based on the spiritual topic these practical skills could be something like home maintenance and repairs gardening or quilting we could also choose to participate in service activities that bless and strengthen others this meeting should enrich and improve each of our lives within the gospel are the answers the world needs to solve the problems that are all around us through the gospel of jesus christ we have the knowledge and the means to establish homes of strength peace love and faith we need not do it alone the programs of the church can help us we also need the help our father in heaven is eager to give us in psalm 1271 ps 1271 we are cautioned except the lord build the house they labour in vain that build it recently my friend richard came home from work to find a very small girl sitting on the curb in front of his house crying he asked if he could help through her sobs she explained that she was lost he told her that this was his house and his wife was inside he told her he knew she shouldnt go with strangers but if she felt comfortable going inside he and his wife would try to find her home they went into his house and his wife linda began to console the little girl im sure you must be very frightened she said i was frightened the girl responded until i saw the picture of jesus hanging on your wall then i knew i would be safe throughout the world many of gods children are lost we who know the truth can help them we can show them a pattern of strong homes and righteous family members we can help them if we have the savior in our homesnot just his picture on the wall but also his teachings his spirit and his love despite the instincts we have been blessed with this kind of home doesnt happen automatically we need spiritual strength and practical skills to build a home where the spirit of the lord is present home family and personal enrichment meeting is a place for us to share sisterhood to gain knowledge to learn skills and to increase testimony this meeting is also the place to rededicate ourselves to our homes and families and to the giving of service wherever it is needed as relief society leaders and all of us as members catch the vision and the excitement of home family and personal enrichment meeting and act out of the resultant enthusiasm we will grow in testimony and spiritual strength we will come closer to our savior and know how to build homes where he can dwell then quoting president thomas s monson the lord even our building inspector may say to us as he said to solomon a builder of another day i have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually 1 kgs 93 pathways to perfection 1973 250 relief society is an organization of divine origin within it lies the power to strengthen sisters and their families and to create a worldwide family of sisters in the name of jesus christ amen
