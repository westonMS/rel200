a testimony of the book of mormon by elder russell m nelson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder russell m nelson when you read the book of mormon concentrate on the principal figure in the bookfrom its first chapter to the lastthe lord jesus christ not long after my call to serve as one of the twelve apostles i was summoned to the office of the president of our quorum president ezra taft benson he expressed deep concern that members of the church did not fully appreciate the value of the book of mormon with emotion in his voice he read to me from the 84th section of the doctrine and covenants your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief and because you have treated lightly the things you have received which vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation1 by that time president benson had completely captured my attention he then concluded his admonition and they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant even the book of mormon2 i shall never forget that lesson since then president howard w hunter president gordon b hinckley and many other leaders of the church have continued to extol the book of mormon to people throughout the world i would like to add my testimony of the divinity of this book i have read it many times i have also read much that has been written about it some authors have focused upon its stories its people or its vignettes of history others have been intrigued by its language structure or its records of weapons geography animal life techniques of building or systems of weights and measures interesting as these matters may be study of the book of mormon is most rewarding when one focuses on its primary purposeto testify of jesus christ by comparison all other issues are incidental when you read the book of mormon concentrate on the principal figure in the bookfrom its first chapter to the lastthe lord jesus christ son of the living god3 and look for a second undergirding theme god will keep his covenants with the remnants of the house of israel4 the book of mormon is a crucial component of that covenant5 it is holy scripture that encompasses sacred writings from the small and large plates of nephi the plates of mormon the plates of ether and the plates of brass which contained the five books of moses a record of the jews and prophecies of the holy prophets6 when mormon abridged these records he noted that he could not write a hundredth part of their proceedings7 thus historical aspects of the book assume secondary significance the holy bible has 66 individual books the book of mormon contains 15 its first book of nephiwritten some six centuries before the birth of jesusrecords that the prophet lehi8 received a vision of the tree of life9 his son nephi prayed to know its meaning in answer he was given a remarkable vision he beheld a virgin bearing a child in her arms he envisioned the redeemer of the world his earthly ministry and his crucifixion he saw 12 others who would follow the holy one and he foresaw the ongoing opposition to the work of god and of his apostles10 other great prophets of the book of mormonin their own way and timetestified of the divinity of the lord jesus christ among them were the brother of jared11 zenock neum and zenos12 testimonies of jesus christ that predated his birth in bethlehem were also recorded from king benjamin abinadi alma the elder alma the younger amulek the sons of mosiah captain moroni the brothers nephi and lehi and samuel the lamanite13 in a seemingly endless sequence of prophetic proclamationstestimonies of all the holy prophets14 for a great many thousand years before his coming15the book of mormon makes the solemn declaration that jesus is the christ our savior and redeemer authors most books contained in libraries of the world were authored for contemporary readers and they were generally written for profit with royalties accruing from successful sales not so with the book of mormon it was written anciently for our day it reveals the endless lordship of jesus christ in accounts of two ancient american dispensations16 preserved for the benefit of us who live in this dispensation of the fulness of times certainly no royalties came to its authors in fact they paid dearly for their privilege of participation what motivated them their devotion to god the books four major writersnephi jacob mormon and moroni17were all eyewitnesses of the lord as was its martyred translator the prophet joseph smith content their writings centered upon the lord his mission and his ministry jacob for example repeatedly referred to the atonement and resurrection of christ beloved brethren wrote jacob be reconciled unto god through the atonement of christ his only begotten son and ye may obtain a resurrection and be presented as the firstfruits of christ unto god and now why not speak of the atonement of christ and attain to a perfect knowledge of him and a knowledge of a resurrection and the world to come18 jacobs advice is priceless and timeless the savior declared that the book of mormon contains the fulness of his everlasting gospel19 how did he define the gospel the resurrected lord taught this is the gospel which i have given unto youthat i came into the world to do the will of my father because my father sent me20 then he amplified that onesentence definition my father sent me that i might be lifted up upon the cross and after that i had been lifted up upon the cross that i might draw all men unto me21 this unique mortal mission of the lordthe gospel as he defined itwe know as the atonement the fulness of the gospel therefore connotes a fuller comprehension of the atonement22 this we do not obtain from the bible alone the word atonement in any of its forms is mentioned only once in the king james version of the new testament23 in the book of mormon it appears 39 times24 the book of mormon also contains more references to the resurrection than does the bible25 the savior referred to the book of mormon as his new covenant with the house of israel26 it is a tangible sign of christs culminating covenant with mankind27 the divine teachings of this book as a third testament clarify doctrine and unify the old testament with the new testament scriptural covenants28 testaments29 and witnesses30 since the beginning of time relate to the atonement of jesus christ the central act of all human history the book of mormon is the most important religious text to be revealed from god to man since the writings of the new testament were compiled nearly two millennia ago31 joseph smith declared the book of mormon to be the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of our religion32 it is the only book that the lord himself has testified to be true33 the crowning event of this sacred record is the personal ministry of the resurrected lord to people of ancient america to them he made this revelatory announcement behold i am jesus christ the son of god i created the heavens and the earth and all things that in them are i was with the father from the beginning the scriptures concerning my coming are fulfilled i am the light and the life of the world whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit him will i baptize with fire and with the holy ghost i have come unto the world to bring redemption unto the world to save the world from sin therefore whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child him will i receive for of such is the kingdom of god i have laid down my life and have taken it up again therefore repent and come unto me and be saved34 after that supernal introduction the master reinforced his identity by allowing the multitudes to thrust their hands into his side and feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet then they knew that the very god of israel stood in their presencehe who had been slain for the sins of the world35 he instructed the people he taught them to pray to repent to be baptized to partake of the sacrament to know of his doctrine to understand the importance of sacred ordinances and covenants and to endure to the end36 the book of mormon is a gift from god to all humankind and he has commanded his people that they should persuade all men to repentance37 he invites all to come unto him and partake of his goodness and he denies none that come unto him black and white bond and free male and female38 translation this appeal to all people must involve many languages and the work of skilled translators the king james version of the bible for example was produced by 50 english scholars who accomplished their work in seven years translating at the rate of one page per day39 expert translators today do well if they can also translate scripture at the rate of one page per day in contrast joseph smith translated the book of mormon at the rate of about 10 pages per day completing the task in about 85 days40 many of us feel good if we can read the book in that time such a pace is even more remarkable considering the circumstances under which the prophet labored in that same period while enduring constant distractions and incessant hostility joseph smith moved more than 100 miles from harmony pennsylvania to fayette new york41 he applied for a copyright42 he received revelations comprising 12 sections of the doctrine and covenants43 heavenly beings restored the holy priesthood yet he completed the translation in less than three months the first presidency provided opportunity for the twelve apostles to see portions of the original manuscript and the printers manuscript of the book of mormon words cannot describe the deep emotions we felt as we examined these precious documents and observed that marks of editing were remarkably rare personal testimony and blessings each individual who prayerfully studies the book of mormon can also receive a testimony of its divinity44 in
