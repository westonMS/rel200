the bishop and his counselors by president boyd k packer acting president of the quorum of the twelve apostles imagepresident boyd k packer the church is no bigger than a ward everything needed for our redemption save for the temple is centered thereand temples now come ever closer to all of us last night in the priesthood session president hinckley gave a tribute counsel and a blessing to our bishops under the rule of two witnesses explained to us by elder oaks yesterday i stand as a second witness years ago i served on a stake high council with emery wight for 10 years emery had served as bishop of rural harper ward his wife lucille became our stake relief society president lucille told me that one spring morning a neighbor called at her door and asked for emery she told him that he was out plowing the neighbor then spoke with great concern earlier that morning he had passed the field and noticed emerys team of horses standing in a halffinished furrow with the reins draped over the plow emery was nowhere in sight the neighbor thought nothing of it until much later when he passed the field again and the team had not moved he climbed the fence and crossed the field to the horses emery was nowhere to be found he hurried to the house to check with lucille lucille calmly replied oh dont be alarmed no doubt someone is in trouble and came to get the bishop the image of that team of horses standing for hours in the field symbolizes the dedication of the bishops in the church and of the counselors who stand by their side every bishop and every counselor figuratively speaking leaves his team standing in an unfinished furrow when someone needs help i have passed that field many times over the years it is a reminder of the sacrifice and the service of those called to serve in bishoprics of wards and of their wives and families without whose help they could not serve recently very early on a sunday morning i stood in that field i looked up toward the home where emery and lucille reared their children and to the foothills beyond as a boy with other scouts i left that home with bishop wight we hiked into the hills with emery teaching us every step of the way a bishop paul wrote to timothy must be blameless the husband of one wife vigilant sober of good behaviour given to hospitality apt to teach1 those words apt to teach have special meaning apt means inclined ready prepared in all the world there is nothing quite like the office of bishop in the church of jesus christ of latterday saints except for parents the bishop has the best opportunity to teach and to cause to be taught the things that matter most and a bishop has the remarkable opportunity to teach parents about their responsibility then he must allow them time to teach their children the bishop is responsible for the young men of the aaronic priesthood and for the young women as well he receives and accounts for tithes and offerings he is responsible for the temporal affairs of the church to seek out the poor and he has many other duties the bishop is to judge his people by the testimony of the just and by the assistance of his counselors according to the laws of the kingdom which are given by the prophets of god2 he is to judge them as to their worthiness to receive the ordinances and serve in offices he is to counsel and correct and to preach the gospel to his flock individually and collectively in all of this he is to teach the gospel of jesus christ the crucifixion the atonement the resurrection the restoration i have heard this described as voluntary service because neither the bishop nor his counselors are paid for what they do they too pay their tithes and offerings and they devote endless hours to their calling they are paid only in blessings as are those who serve with them but one does not exactly volunteer or aspire to be bishop he is called to be bishop called of god by prophecy then he is both ordained and set apart by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority to preach the gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof3 a man is ordained a bishop an office in the priesthood then he is set apart and given the keys to preside over a ward he with his two counselors form a bishoprica type of presidency once ordained he is a bishop for the rest of his life when he is released from presiding over a ward his ordination becomes dormant if called again to preside over a ward his previous ordination is reactivated when he is released it becomes dormant again inherent in the ordination to be bishop is both the right and the obligation to be directed by inspiration the bishop has the power to discern by the spirit what he is to do revelation is the one credential that all bishops have in common bishops come from many cultures many occupations they vary in experience personality and age but they do not differ in their right to be guided spiritually years ago a friend of mine went to a large university to study under the ranking authority in the field of counseling and guidance this professor quickly took an interest in this personable intelligent young latterday saint he attracted attention as he moved through the course work required for a doctors degree he chose the latterday saint bishop as the subject for his dissertation all went well until he described the ordination of a bishop the power of discernment and the right of a bishop to spiritual guidance his doctoral committee felt that such references had no place in a scholarly paper and they insisted that he take them out he thought he might at least say that latterday saints believe the bishop has spiritual insight but the committee denied him even this for they would be quite embarrassed to have this spiritual ingredient included in a scholarly dissertation he was told that with some little accommodationspecifically leaving out all the references to revelationhis dissertation would be published and his reputation established he did the best he could his dissertation did not contain enough about the spirit to satisfy him and too much to be fully accepted by his worldly professors but he received his degree i asked this friend what was the most important thing he had learned in his study of bishops he answered i learned that the mantle is far far greater than the intellect that the priesthood is the guiding power do not doubt that an ordinary soul called from the ranks to be bishop can give inspired counsel and correction unfortunately some who could be helped so much are reluctant to seek counsel from the bishop while others endlessly seem to need counseling and comfort and feel neglected if they are not constantly tended bishops are inspired each of us has agency to accept or reject counsel from our leaders but never disregard the counsel of your bishop whether given over the pulpit or individually and never turn down a call from your bishop it can be a tough world a tough life and in some ways its even tougher in the church eliza r snow wrote think not when you gather to zion your troubles and trials are through that nothing but comfort and pleasure are waiting in zion for you no no tis designed as a furnace all substance all textures to try to burn all the wood and the stubble the gold from the dross purify think not when you gather to zion the saints here have nothing to do but to look to your personal welfare and always be comforting you no those who are faithful are doing what they find to do with their might to gather the scattered of israel they labor by day and by night4 when we need help the bishop is there but be careful not to impose unnecessarily upon his time bishops can do only so much the bishopric must have time to make a living and time for their own families often we are asked how the relatively few apostles in the first presidency and the twelve can manage the church now more than 10 million strong actually the church is no bigger than a ward each bishop has counselors he wears a special mantle and is designated as the presiding high priest in the ward there are other high priests and there is a presidency of elders there are auxiliary leaders and teachers sufficient for the need when we serve obediently ever willingly our pay like the bishops comes in blessings no matter if the church grows to be a hundred million as it surely will it will still be no bigger than a ward everything needed for our redemption save for the temple is centered thereand temples now come ever closer to all of us small numbers of wards are grouped together under the shelter of stakes and branches under districts there is a stake presidency and a council to train the bishopric and other leaders to train those who serve with them this organization in place across the world is a product of the restoration of the gospel of jesus christ this miracle of willing service is possible because of individual testimonies of the redeemer the revelation present when this system was conceived did not end there for the purpose of it all is to shelter families families are grouped together in a ward or branch it is the responsibility of the bishop to see that each family is bound together in enduring covenants and each individual is safe and happy the system works best when the bishop recognizes the preeminent responsibility of parents while the bishop is sometimes referred to as the father of the ward we should remember he is not called to rear the children of the ward our handbooks state parents have primary responsibility for the welfare of their children5 the bishopric and other ward leaders support but do not replace them in this responsibility6 quorums auxiliaries programs and activities in the church should strengthen and support the family they should enhance gospelcentered family activities not compete with them7 the first presidency recently wrote to the church the home is the basis of a righteous life and no other instrumentality can take its place or fulfill its essential functions in carrying forward this godgiven responsibility however worthy and appropriate other demands or activities may be they must not be permitted to displace the divinelyappointed duties that only parents and families can adequately perform8 families like wards vary in size and shape time moves on one generation replaces another babies are born and mature to become parents and then grandparents one family divides itself to become several wards grow and are divided where there was one there are others whatever happens in the world whatever heights of civility or depths of depravity emerge in society the plan remains unaltered the church will grow until it fills the whole earth at once it will remain no bigger than the ward the church provides activities and associations and ordinances and ordinations and covenants and contracts and corrections which prepare each of us for exaltation it follows a pattern made in the heavens for no mortal mind could have designed it now and always hereafter ordinary men will leave their teams standing in an unfinished furrow the reins draped over the plow when someone needs help the women and children serve with them and will sustain them supplied with truth from the books of revelation the gem of them all being the book of mormon which testifies of christ of the atonement of his resurrection and i testify of him sheltered in the ward within the plan which he revealed we with our families will be safe in the name of jesus christ amen notes 1 tim 32 dc 5818 emphasis added a
