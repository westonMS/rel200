strengthening families our sacred duty by elder robert d hales of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder robert d hales the key to strengthening our families is having the spirit of the lord come into our homes the goal of our families is to be on the strait and narrow path strengthening families is our sacred duty as parents children extended family members leaders teachers and individual members of the church the importance of spiritually strengthening families is taught clearly in the scriptures father adam and mother eve taught their sons and daughters the gospel the sacrifices of abel were accepted by the lord whom he loved cain on the other hand loved satan more than god and committed serious sins adam and eve mourned before the lord because of cain and his brethren but they never ceased to teach their children the gospel see moses 512 18 20 27 moses 61 58 we must understand that each of our children comes with varying gifts and talents some like abel seem to be given gifts of faith at birth others struggle with every decision they make as parents we should never let the searching and struggling of our children make us waver or lose our faith in the lord alma the younger when racked with torment and harrowed up by the memory of his many sins remembered hearing his father teach about the coming of jesus christ a son of god to atone for the sins of the world alma 3617 his fathers words led to his conversion in like manner our teaching and testimony will be remembered by our children the 2000 stripling warriors in the army of helaman testified that their righteous mothers had powerfully taught gospel principles to them see alma 564748 at a time of great spiritual searching enos said the words which i had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life sunk deep into my heart enos 13 in the doctrine and covenants the lord says that parents are to teach their children to understand the doctrine of repentance faith in christ the son of the living god and of baptism and the gift of the holy ghost by the laying on of the hands when eight years old and they shall also teach their children to pray and to walk uprightly before the lord dc 6825 28 as we teach our children the gospel through word and example our families are spiritually strengthened and fortified the words of living prophets are clear regarding our sacred duty to strengthen our families spiritually in 1995 the first presidency and the council of the twelve apostles issued a proclamation to the world declaring that the family is central to the creators plan for the eternal destiny of his children husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness to provide for their physical and spiritual needs to teach them to love and serve one another and to observe the commandments of god the family a proclamation to the world ensign nov 1995 102 liahona june 1996 1011 in february of this year the first presidency issued a call to all parents to devote their best efforts to the teaching and rearing of their children in gospel principles which will keep them close to the church the home is the basis of a righteous life and no other instrumentality can take its place or fulfill its essential functions in carrying forward this godgiven responsibility in the february letter the first presidency taught that by teaching and rearing children in gospel principles parents can protect their families from corrosive elements they further counseled parents and children to give highest priority to family prayer family home evening gospel study and instruction and wholesome family activities however worthy and appropriate other demands or activities may be they must not be permitted to displace the divinelyappointed duties that only parents and families can adequately perform first presidency letter 11 feb 1999 cited in church news 27 feb 1999 3 with the help of the lord and his doctrine all the hurtful effects from challenges a family may meet can be understood and overcome whatever the needs of family members may be we can strengthen our families as we follow the counsel given by prophets the key to strengthening our families is having the spirit of the lord come into our homes the goal of our families is to be on the strait and narrow path countless things can be done within the walls of our homes to strengthen the family may i share a few ideas that may help identify the areas that need strengthening in our own families i offer them in a spirit of encouragement knowing that each familyand each family memberis unique make our homes a safe place where each family member feels love and a sense of belonging realize that each child has varying gifts and abilities each is an individual requiring special love and care remember a soft answer turneth away wrath prov 151 when my sweetheart and i were sealed in the salt lake temple elder harold b lee gave us wise counsel when you raise your voice in anger the spirit departs from your home we must never out of anger lock the door of our home or our heart to our children like the prodigal son our children need to know that when they come to themselves they can turn to us for love and counsel spend individual time with our children letting them choose the activity and the subject of conversation block out distractions encourage our childrens private religious behavior such as personal prayer personal scripture study and fasting for specific needs measure their spiritual growth by observing their demeanor language and conduct toward others pray daily with our children read the scriptures together i remember my own mother and father reading the scriptures as we children sat on the floor and listened sometimes they would ask what does that scripture mean to you or how does it make you feel then they would listen to us as we responded in our own words read the words of the living prophets and other inspiring articles for children youth and adults in church magazines we can fill our homes with the sound of worthy music as we sing together from the hymnbook and the childrens songbook hold family home evening every week as parents we are sometimes too intimidated to teach or testify to our children i have been guilty of that in my own life our children need to have us share spiritual feelings with them and to teach and bear testimony to them hold family councils to discuss family plans and concerns some of the most effective family councils are one on one with each family member help our children know their ideas are important listen to them and learn from them invite missionaries to teach lessactive or nonmember friends in our homes show that we sustain and support church leaders eat together when possible and have meaningful mealtime discussions work together as a family even if it may be faster and easier to do the job ourselves talk with our sons and daughters as we work together i had that opportunity every saturday with my father help our children learn how to build good friendships and make their friends feel welcome in our homes get to know the parents of the friends of our children teach our children by example how to budget time and resources help them learn selfreliance and the importance of preparing for the future teach our children the history of our ancestors and of our own family history build family traditions plan and carry out meaningful vacations together considering our childrens needs talents and abilities help them create happy memories improve their talents and build their feelings of selfworth by word and example teach moral values and a commitment to obeying the commandments after my baptism and confirmation my mother drew me aside and asked what do you feel i described as best i could the warm feeling of peace comfort and happiness i had mother explained that what i was feeling was the gift i had just received the gift of the holy ghost she told me that if i lived worthy of it i would have that gift with me continually that was a teaching moment that has lived with me all my life teach our children the significance of baptism and confirmation receiving the gift of the holy ghost partaking of the sacrament honoring the priesthood and making and keeping temple covenants they need to know the importance of living worthy of a temple recommend and preparing for a temple marriage if you have not yet been sealed in the temple to your spouse or children work as a family to receive temple blessings set temple goals as a family be worthy of the priesthood which you hold brethren and use it to bless the lives of your family through the power of the melchizedek priesthood dedicate our homes resources are available outside the home wise use of them will strengthen our families encourage our children to serve in the church and community talk to our childrens teachers coaches counselors advisers and church leaders about our concerns and the needs of our children know what our children are doing in their spare time influence their choice of movies television programs and videos if they are on the internet know what they are doing help them see the importance of wholesome entertainment encourage worthwhile school activities know what our children are studying help them with their homework help them realize the importance of education and of preparing for employment and selfsufficiency young women attend relief society when you reach your 18th birthday some of you may be reluctant to make that transition you may fear that you wont fit in my young sisters this is not the case there is much in relief society for you it can be a blessing to you throughout your life young men honor the aaronic priesthood it is the preparatory priesthood preparing you for the melchizedek priesthood become fully active in the elders quorum when you are ordained to the melchizedek priesthood the brotherhood the quorum instruction and the opportunities to serve others will bless you and your family throughout your life every family can be strengthened in one way or another if the spirit of the lord is brought into our homes and we teach by his example act with faith dont react with fear when our teenagers begin testing family values parents need to go to the lord for guidance on the specific needs of each family member this is the time for added love and support and to reinforce your teachings on how to make choices it is frightening to allow our children to learn from the mistakes they may make but their willingness to choose the lords way and family values is greater when the choice comes from within than when we attempt to force those values upon them the lords way of love and acceptance is better than satans way of force and coercion especially in rearing teenagers remember the prophet joseph smiths words nothing is so much calculated to lead people to forsake sin as to take them by the hand and watch over them with tenderness when persons manifest the least kindness and love to me o what power it has over my mind while the opposite course has a tendency to harrow up all the harsh feelings and depress the human mind teachings of the prophet joseph smith sel joseph fielding smith 1976 240 while we may despair when after all we can do some of our children stray from the path of righteousness the words of orson f whitney can comfort us though some of the sheep may wander the eye of the shepherd is upon them and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of divine providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold either in this life or the life to come they will return they will have to pay their debt to justice they will suffer for their sins and may tread a thorny path but if it leads them at last like the penitent prodigal to a loving and forgiving mothers and fathers heart and home the painful experience will not have been in vain pray for our careless and disobedient children hold on to them with our faith hope on trust on till you see the salvation of god orson f whitney in conference report apr 1929 110 what if you are single or have not been blessed with children do you need to be concerned about the counsel regarding families yes it is something we all need to learn in earth life unmarried adult members can often lend a special kind of strength to the family becoming a tremendous source of support acceptance and love to their families and the families of those around them many adult members of the extended family do much parenting in their own right grandparents aunts and uncles brothers and sisters nieces and nephews cousins and other family members can have great impact on the family i want to express my appreciation for those in my own extended family who have guided me by their example and testimony sometimes extended family members can say things parents cannot say without starting an argument after a long hearttoheart discussion with her mother one young woman said it would be awful to tell you and dad i had done something wrong but it would be worse to tell aunt susan i just couldnt let her down knowing that we are in mortality to learn and to develop our faith we should understand that there must be opposition in all things during a family council in my own home my wife said when you may think that someone has a perfect family you just do not know them well enough brothers and sisters as parents let us heed the admonition even the rebuke given by the lord to joseph smith and the leaders of the church in 1833 to set in order our own house dc 9343 i have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth dc 9340 set in order our family and see that they are more diligent and concerned at home and pray always or they shall be removed out of their place dc 9350 the prophets of our day have given a similar admonition and warning to parents to set in order our families may we be blessed with the inspiration and love to meet opposition with faith within our families we will then know that our trials are to draw us closer to the lord and to one another may we listen to a prophets voice and set in order our own homes see dc 934149 the family is strengthened as we draw near to the lord and each member of the family is strengthened as we lift and strengthen and love and care for one another thee lift me and ill lift thee and well ascend together quaker proverb may we be able to welcome and maintain the spirit of the lord in our homes to strengthen our families that each of our family members can stay on the strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life 2 ne 3118 i pray in the name of jesus christ amen
