repent of our selfishness dc 568 by elder neal a maxwell of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder neal a maxwell meekness is the real cure for it does not merely mask selfishness but dissolves it in one degree or another we all struggle with selfishness since it is so common why worry about selfishness anyway because selfishness is really selfdestruction in slow motion no wonder the prophet joseph smith urged let every selfish feeling be not only buried but annihilated teachings of the prophet joseph smith sel joseph fielding smith 1976 178 hence annihilationnot moderationis the destination surging selfishness for example has shrunken some people into ciphers they seek to erase their emptiness by sensations but in the arithmetic of appetite anything multiplied by zero still totals zero each spasm of selfishness narrows ones universe that much more by reducing his awareness of or concern with others in spite of its outward worldly swagger such indulgent individualism is actually provincial like goldfish in a bowl congratulating themselves on their selfsufficiency never mind the food pellets or changes of water long ago it took a copernicus to tell a provincial world that this planet was not the center of the universe some selfish moderns need a copernican reminder that they are not the center of the universe either the early and familiar forms of selfishness are building up self at the expense of others claiming or puffing credit being glad when others go wrong resenting the genuine successes of others preferring public vindication to private reconciliation and taking advantage of one because of his words 2 ne 288 by focusing on himself a selfish person finds it easier to bear false witness to steal and covet since nothing should be denied him no wonder it is so easy for governments to pander to the appetites of the natural man especially if the trains continue to run on time reassuring him all the while that his permissiveness is somehow permissible selfishness likewise causes us to be discourteous disdainful and selfcentered while withholding from others needed goods praise and recognition as we selfishly pass them by and notice them not see morm 839 later on come rudeness brusqueness and the further flexing of elbows in contrast to the path of selfishness there is no room for road rage on the straight and narrow way there will be no spouse or child abuse when there is unselfish love at home furthermore unselfishness is best grown in the family garden and likewise diligently performing seemingly ordinary church duties can further help us to overcome selfishness the unselfish are also more free as g k chesterton said if we can be interested in others even if they are not interested in us we will find ourselves under a freer sky and in a street full of splendid strangers orthodoxy 1959 21 in daily discipleship the many ways to express selfishness are matched by many ways to avoid it meekness is the real cure for it does not merely mask selfishness but dissolves it smaller steps could include asking ourselves inwardly before undertaking an important action whose needs am i really trying to meet or in significant moments of selfexpression we can first count to 10 such thoughtful filtering can multiply our offering by 10 as a mesh of reflective meekness filters out destructive and effusive ego we can also meekly let our ideas have a life of their own without oversponsoring them rather let the spirit impel our worthy ideas alas gross individual selfishness is finally acculturated then societies can eventually become without order without mercy without love perverted and past feeling see moro 9 society thereby reflects a grim cumulative tally which signals a major cultural decline this happened anciently when a people actually became weak because of their transgression hel 426 speaking behaviorally when what was once the lesser voice of the people becomes more dominant then the judgments of god and the consequences of foolish selfishness follow see mosiah 292627 cultural decline is accelerated when singleinterest segments of society become indifferent to general values once widely shared this drift is facilitated by the indifferent or the indulgent as society is led carefully down to hell see 2 ne 2821 some may not join in this drift but instead they step aside whereas once they might have constrained as is their representative right of such circumstances yeats lamented the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity w b yeats the second coming today in place of some traditionally shared values is a demanding conformity pushed ironically by those who eventually will not tolerate those who once tolerated them while incremental iniquity may not cause a huge decline all at once the same somber direction is nevertheless continued subtly and carefully with no arousing jolts or jars see 2 ne 2821 such are some of the proximate consequences of selfishness yet some of its consequences are ultimateimpacting us salvationally selfishness is actually the detonator of all the cardinal sins it is the hammer for the breaking of the ten commandments whether by neglecting parents the sabbath or by inducing false witness murder and envy no wonder the selfish individual is often willing to break a covenant in order to fix an appetite no wonder those who will later comprise the telestial kingdom after they have paid a price were once unrepentant adulterers whoremongers and those who both loved and made lies some of the selfish wrongly believe that there is no divine law anyway so there is no sin see 2 ne 213 situational ethics are thus made to order for the selfish so in the management of self one can conquer by his genius and strength because there really is no crime whatsoever see alma 3017 unsurprisingly therefore selfishness leads to terrible perceptual and behavioral blunders for instance cain corrupted by his seeking of power said after slaying abel i am free moses 533 see also moses 615 one of the worst consequences of severe selfishness therefore is this profound loss of proportionality like straining at gnats while swallowing camels see matt 2324 see also jst in footnote 24a today there are for example those who strain over various gnats but swallow the practice of partialbirth abortions small wonder therefore that selfishness magnifies a mess of pottage into a banquet and makes 30 pieces of silver look like a treasure trove developmentally what transpires is like what happened to an ancient group of children who did grow up that they became for themselveshardened and errant 3 ne 129 see also 3 ne 130 devastating cultural change can and does happen in the space of not many years including replacing the muchneeded spirit of community with a diversified alliance of dalliance see hel 426 determined to walk in his own way the natural man often persists to the point where he is past feeling having been sedated by pleasing the carnal mind see 1 ne 1745 see also eph 419 sadly like the drug addict he is always in need of a fresh fix the severely selfish use others but do not love them let the uriahs of the world beware see 2 sam 11317 centuries before christ the prophet jacob warned unchaste men ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives and lost the confidence of your children because of your bad examples before them jacob 235 when love waxes cold let the poor and the needy beware too for they will be neglected as happened in ancient sodom see matt 2412 see also ezek 1649 strange as it seems when severely selfish people are no longer little in their own sight everybody else shrinks see 1 sam 1517 even the early droplets of selfish decisions suggest a direction then the little inflecting rivulets come merging into small brooks and soon into larger streams finally one is swept along by a vast river which flows into the gulf of misery and endless wo hel 512 we actually have an obligation to notice genuine telltale societal signs it was jesus who warned o ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky but can ye not discern the signs of the times suggesting the need for a different kind of weather forecasting matt 163 for what happens in cultural decline both leaders and followers are really accountable historically of course it is easy to criticize bad leaders but we should not give followers a free pass otherwise in their rationalization of their degeneration they may say they were just following orders while the leader was just ordering followers however much more is required of followers in a democratic society wherein individual character matters so much in both leaders and followers the prophet mormon unselfishly consented to lead a people who were in steep decline he prayed for them but confided that his prayers were without faith because of the peoples wickedness see morm 312 other times a visionary leader like joseph in egypt lifts people out of the endangered routine theyre in by preparing them for the specific challenges of the future see gen 414657 a few like lincoln though in a political role provide spiritual leadership as well lincoln by the way warned of how individuals of ambition and talents would continue to arise and that such an individual thirsts and burns for distinction and if possible will have it whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen cited in john wesley hill abraham lincolnman of god 1927 74 emphasis in original of unselfish george washington it has been written in all history few men who possessed unassailable power have used that power so gently and selfeffacingly for what their best instincts told them was the welfare of their neighbors and all mankind james thomas flexner washington the indispensable man 1984 xvi power is most safe with those like washington who are not in love with it a narcissist society in which each person is busy looking out for number one can build neither brotherhood nor community arent we glad in this easter season and in all seasons that jesus did not selfishly look out for number one no wonder we have been told thou shalt have no other gods before me and this includes selfworship ex 203 emphasis added one way or another the grossly selfish will finally be shattered whimpering against the jagged concrete consequences of their selfishness in contrast as i close consider unselfish melissa howes whose comparatively young father died of cancer several months ago just before melissa who was then nine was voice in family prayer pleading heavenly father bless my daddy and if you need him more than us you can have him we want him but thy will be done and please help us not to be mad at you letter from christie howes 25 feb 1998 what spiritual submissiveness for one so young what an unselfish understanding of the plan of salvation may unselfish submissiveness be our path too in the holy name of jesus christ amen
