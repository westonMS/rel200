come follow me by president russell m nelson jesus christ invites us to take the covenant path back home to our heavenly parents and be with those we love my beloved brothers and sisters my wife wendy and i rejoice in being with you on this sabbath morning much has happened since our last general conference new temples have been dedicated in concepci√≥n chile barranquilla colombia and rome italy we experienced a rich outpouring of the spirit at these sacred events i congratulate the many women and men who have recently read the book of mormon and discovered joy and hidden treasures i am inspired by reports about miracles received i marvel at 11yearold young men who now as deacons worthily pass the sacrament each sunday they go to the temple along with our 11yearold young women who are now eagerly learning and serving as beehives both young men and young women are preaching gospel truths with clarity and conviction i rejoice with children and youth who are helping to teach the gospel in their homes as they work with their parents to follow the homecentered churchsupported curriculum we received this photo of fouryearold blake who early on a saturday morning grabbed a church book and exclaimed i need to feed my spirit imageblake feeding his spirit blake we are thrilled with you and others who are choosing to feed their spirits by feasting on the truths of the restored gospel of jesus christ and we delight in knowing that many are receiving the power of god in their lives as they worship and serve in the temple as many of you know our family experienced a tender separation three months ago when our daughter wendy departed from this mortal life in the final days of her battle with cancer i was blessed with the opportunity to have our farewell daddydaughter conversation i held her hands and told her how much i loved her and how grateful i was to be her father i said you married in the temple and faithfully honored your covenants you and your husband welcomed seven children into your home and raised them to be devout disciples of jesus christ valiant church members and contributing citizens and they have chosen spouses of that same caliber your daddy is very very proud of you you have brought me much joy she quietly responded thank you daddy it was a tender tearful moment for us during her 67 years we worked together sang together and often skied together but that evening we talked of things that matter most such as covenants ordinances obedience faith family fidelity love and eternal life we miss our daughter greatly however because of the restored gospel of jesus christ we do not worry about her as we continue to honor our covenants with god we live in anticipation of our being with her again meanwhile were serving the lord here and she is serving him therein paradise1 actually my wife and i visited paradise earlier this yearparadise california that is as it happened our scheduled visit there came less than 40 hours after our daughter departed from this world we along with elder kevin w pearson and his wife june were bolstered by the saints of the chico california stake we learned of their great faith their ministering and the miracles that occurred even amidst their devastating losses from the most destructive wildfire in the history of california while there we spoke at length with a young police officer john who was one of many brave first responders he recalled the thick darkness that descended upon paradise on november 8 2018 as flames and embers raced through the town devouring property and possessions like a scourge and leaving nothing but piles of ash and stark brick chimneys imagemeetinghouse after fire for 15 hours john drove through an impenetrable darkness that was streaked with javelins of threatening embers as he helped person after person family after family escape to safetyall at the peril of his own life yet during that strenuous ordeal what terrified john most was his allconsuming question where is my family after many long terrifying hours of anguish he finally learned of their safe evacuation the account of johns concern for his family has prompted me to speak today with those of you who may ask when approaching the end of your mortal life where is my family in that coming day when you will complete your mortal probation and enter the spirit world you will be brought facetoface with that heartwrenching question where is my family jesus christ teaches the way back to our eternal home he understands our heavenly fathers plan of eternal progression better than any of us after all he is the keystone of it all he is our redeemer our healer and our savior ever since adam and eve were expelled from the garden of eden jesus the christ has offered his mighty arm to help all who choose to follow him repeatedly scriptures record that despite all kinds of sins from all kinds of people his arms are outstretched still2 the spirit in each of us naturally yearns for family love to last forever love songs perpetuate a false hope that love is all you need if you want to be together forever and some erroneously believe that the resurrection of jesus christ provides a promise that all people will be with their loved ones after death in truth the savior himself has made it abundantly clear that while his resurrection assures that every person who ever lived will indeed be resurrected and live forever3 much more is required if we want to have the high privilege of exaltation salvation is an individual matter but exaltation is a family matter listen to these words spoken by the lord jesus christ to his prophet all covenants contracts bonds obligations oaths vows performances connections associations or expectations that are not made and entered into and sealed by the holy spirit of promise are of no efficacy virtue or force in and after the resurrection from the dead for all contracts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead4 so what is required for a family to be exalted forever we qualify for that privilege by making covenants with god keeping those covenants and receiving essential ordinances this has been true since the beginning of time adam and eve noah and his wife abraham and sarah lehi and sariah and all other devoted disciples of jesus christsince the world was createdhave made the same covenants with god they have received the same ordinances that we as members of the lords restored church today have made those covenants that we receive at baptism and in the temple the savior invites all to follow him into the waters of baptism and in time to make additional covenants with god in the temple and receive and be faithful to those further essential ordinances all these are required if we want to be exalted with our families and with god forever the anguish of my heart is that many people whom i love whom i admire and whom i respect decline his invitation they ignore the pleadings of jesus christ when he beckons come follow me5 i understand why god weeps6 i also weep for such friends and relatives they are wonderful men and women devoted to their family and civic responsibilities they give generously of their time energy and resources and the world is better for their efforts but they have chosen not to make covenants with god they have not received the ordinances that will exalt them with their families and bind them together forever7 how i wish i could visit with them and invite them to consider seriously the enabling laws of the lord ive wondered what i could possibly say so they would feel how much the savior loves them and know how much i love them and come to recognize how covenantkeeping women and men can receive a fulness of joy8 they need to understand that while there is a place for them hereafterwith wonderful men and women who also chose not to make covenants with godthat is not the place where families will be reunited and be given the privilege to live and progress forever that is not the kingdom where they will experience the fulness of joyof neverending progression and happiness9 those consummate blessings can come only by living in an exalted celestial realm with god our eternal father his son jesus christ and our wonderful worthy and qualified family members i feel to say to my reticent friends in this life you have never settled for second best in anything yet as you resist fully embracing the restored gospel of jesus christ you are choosing to settle for second best the savior said in my fathers house are many mansions10 however as you choose not to make covenants with god you are settling for a most meager roof over your head throughout all eternity i would further entreat my reticent friends by saying pour out your heart to god ask him if these things are true make time to study his words really study if you truly love your family and if you desire to be exalted with them throughout eternity pay the price nowthrough serious study and fervent prayerto know these eternal truths and then to abide by them if you are not sure you even believe in god start there understand that in the absence of experiences with god one can doubt the existence of god so put yourself in a position to begin having experiences with him humble yourself pray to have eyes to see gods hand in your life and in the world around you ask him to tell you if he is really thereif he knows you ask him how he feels about you and then listen one such dear friend of mine had limited experiences with god but he longed to be with his departed wife so he asked me to help him i encouraged him to meet with our missionaries in order to understand the doctrine of christ and learn of gospel covenants ordinances and blessings that he did but he felt the course they advised would require him to make too many changes in his life he said those commandments and covenants are just too difficult for me also i cant possibly pay tithing and i dont have time to serve in the church then he asked me once i die please do the necessary temple work for my wife and me so that we can be together again thankfully i am not this mans judge but i do question the efficacy of proxy temple work for a man who had the opportunity to be baptized in this lifeto be ordained to the priesthood and receive temple blessings while here in mortalitybut who made the conscious decision to reject that course my dear brothers and sisters jesus christ invites us to take the covenant path back home to our heavenly parents and be with those we love he invites us to come follow me now as president of his church i plead with you who have distanced yourselves from the church and with you who have not yet really sought to know that the saviors church has been restored do the spiritual work to find out for yourselves and please do it now time is running out i testify that god lives jesus is the christ his church and the fulness of his gospel have been restored to bless our lives with joy here and hereafter i so testify in the name of jesus christ amen notes see alma 401214 see jeremiah 275 matthew 2337 luke 1334 alma 533 3 nephi 914 the
