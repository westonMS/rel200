think to thank by president thomas s monson first counselor in the first presidency imagepresident thomas s monson do we give thanks to god for his unspeakable gift 2 cor 915 and his rich blessings so abundantly bestowed upon us in a land far away and at a time long ago jesus journeyed to jerusalem he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go shew yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan and jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that returned to give glory to god save this stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole1 from the 30th psalm david pledges o lord my god i will give thanks unto thee for ever2 the apostle paul in his epistle to the corinthians proclaimed thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift3 and to the thessalonians in every thing give thanks for this is the will of god4 my brothers and sisters do we give thanks to god for his unspeakable gift and his rich blessings so abundantly bestowed upon us do we pause and ponder ammons words now my brethren we see that god is mindful of every people whatsoever land they may be in yea he numbereth his people over all the earth now this is my joy and my great thanksgiving yea and i will give thanks unto my god forever5 robert w woodruff a prominent business leader of a former time toured the united states giving a lecture which he entitled a capsule course in human relations in his message he said that the two most important words in the english language are these thank you gracias danke merciwhatever language is spoken thank you frequently expressed will cheer your spirit broaden your friendships and lift your lives to a higher pathway as you journey toward perfection there is a simplicityeven a sinceritywhen thank you is spoken the beauty and eloquence of an expression of gratitude is reflected in a newspaper story of some years ago the district of columbia police auctioned off about 100 unclaimed bicycles friday one dollar said an 11yearold boy as the bidding opened on the first bike the bidding however went much higher one dollar the boy repeated hopefully each time another bike came up the auctioneer who had been auctioning stolen or lost bikes for 43 years noticed that the boys hopes seemed to soar higher whenever a racertype bicycle was put up then there was just one racer left the bidding went to eight dollars sold to that boy over there for nine dollars said the auctioneer he took eight dollars from his own pocket and asked the boy for his dollar the youngster turned it over in pennies nickels dimes and quarterstook his bike and started to leave but he went only a few feet carefully parking his new possession he went back gratefully threw his arms around the auctioneers neck and cried when was the last time we felt gratitude as deeply as did this boy the deeds others perform in our behalf might not be as poignant but certainly there are kind acts that warrant our expressions of gratitude the song frequently sung in the sunday school of our youth placed the spirit of thanksgiving into the depths of our souls when upon lifes billows you are tempest tossed when you are discouraged thinking all is lost count your many blessings name them one by one and it will surprise you what the lord has done6 astronaut gordon cooper while orbiting the earth over 30 years ago offered this sweet and simple prayer of thanks father thank you especially for letting me fly this flight thank you for the privilege of being able to be in this position to be up in this wondrous place seeing all these many startling wonderful things that you have created7 we are thankful for blessings we cannot measure for gifts we cannot appraise for books music art and for the great inventions which make these blessings available for the laughter of little children for the means for relieving human suffering and increasing the enjoyment of life for everything good and uplifting8 the prophet alma urged counsel with the lord in all thy doings and he will direct thee for good yea when thou liest down at night lie down unto the lord that he may watch over you in your sleep and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto god and if ye do these things ye shall be lifted up at the last day9 i would like to mention three instances where i believe a sincere thank you could lift a heavy heart inspire a good deed and bring heavens blessings closer to the challenges of our day first may i ask that we express thanks to our parents for life for caring for sacrificing for laboring to provide a knowledge of our heavenly fathers plan for happiness from sinai the words thunder to our conscience honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee10 i know of no sweeter expression toward a parent than that spoken by our savior upon the cross when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home11 next have we thought on occasion of a certain teacher at school or at church who seemed to quicken our desire to learn who instilled in us a commitment to live with honor the story is told of a group of men who were talking about people who had influenced their lives and for whom they were grateful one man thought of a high school teacher who had introduced him to tennyson he decided to write and thank her in time written in a feeble scrawl came the teachers reply my dear willie i cant tell you how much your note meant to me i am in my 80s living alone in a small room cooking my own meals lonely and like the last leaf lingering behind you will be interested to know that i taught school for 50 years and yours is the first note of appreciation i have ever received it came on a blue cold morning and it cheered me as nothing has for years we owe an eternal debt of gratitude to all of those past and present who have given so much of themselves that we might have so much ourselves third i mention an expression of thank you to ones peers the teenage years can be difficult for the teens themselves as well as for their parents these are trying times in the life of a boy or a girl each boy wants to make the football team each girl wants to be the beauty queen many are called but few are chosen12 could have an application here let me share with you a modernday miracle which occurred a year or so ago at murray high school near salt lake city where every person was a winner and not a loser was to be found a newspaper article highlighted the event it was entitled homecoming shows true spirit students elect 2 disabled girls to murray royalty the article began ted and ruth eyre did what any parents would do when their daughter shellie became a finalist for murray high school homecoming queen they counseled her to be a good sport in case she didnt win they explained only one girl among the 10 would be selected queen as student body officers crowned the schools homecoming royalty in the school gym thursday night shellie eyre experienced instead inclusion the 17yearold senior born with down syndrome was selected by fellow students as homecoming queen as ted eyre escorted his daughter onto the gym floor as the candidates were introduced the gym erupted into deafening cheers and applause they were greeted with a standing ovation similar standing ovations were extended to shellies attendants one of whom april pershon has physical and mental disabilities resulting from a brain hemorrhage suffered when she was just 10 years old when the ovations had ceased the school vice principal glo merrill said tonight the students voted on inner beauty obviously moved parents school administrators and students wept openly said one student im so happy i cried when they came out i think murray high is so awesome to do this13 i extend a heartfelt thank you to one and all who made this night one ever to be remembered the scottish poet james barries words seem appropriate god gave us memories that we might have june roses in the december of our lives in august of this year there occurred a tragedy in salt lake county it was reported in the local and national press five beautiful little girlsso young so vibrant so lovinghiding away as children often do in their games of hideandseek entered the trunk of a parents car the trunk lid was pulled shut they were unable to escape and all perished from heat exhaustion the entire community was so kind so thoughtful so caring in the passing of alisha ashley mckell audrey and jaesha flowers food calls visits and prayers were shared on the sunday after the devastating event occurred long lines of automobiles filled with grieving occupants drove ever so slowly past the smith homethe scene of the accident sister monson and i wished to be among those who expressed condolences in this way as we drove by we felt we were on holy ground we literally crept along at a snails pace along the street it was as though we could visualize a traffic sign reading please drive slowly children at play tears filled our eyes and compassion flowed from our hearts at the funeral as well as the evening prior thousands passed by the caskets and expressed support for the grieving parents and grandparents in two of the three families the deceased children were all the children they had frequently death comes as an intruder it is an enemy that suddenly appears in the midst of lifes feast putting out its lights and gaiety it visits the aged as they walk on faltering feet its summons is heard by those who have scarcely reached midway in lifes journey and often it hushes the laughter of little children at the funeral services for the five little angels i counseled there is one phrase which should be erased from your thinking and from the words you speak aloud it is the phrase if only it is counterproductive and is not conducive to the spirit of healing and of peace rather recall the words of proverbs trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths14 before the closing of the caskets i noted that each child held a favorite toy a soft gift to cuddle i reflected on the words of the poet eugene field the little toy dog is covered with dust but sturdy and staunch he stands and the little toy soldier is red with rust and his musket moulds in his hands time was when the little toy dog was new and the soldier was passing fair and that was the time when our little boy blue kissed them and put them there now dont you go till i come he said and dont you make any noise so toddling off to his trundlebed he dreamt of the pretty toys and as he was dreaming an angel song awakened our little boy blue oh the years are many the years are long but the little toy friends are true ay faithful to little boy blue they stand each in the same old place awaiting the touch of a little hand the smile of a little face and they wonder as waiting the long years through in the dust of that little chair what has become of our little boy blue since he kissed them and put them there15 the little toy dog and the soldier fair may wonder but god in his infinite mercy has not left grieving loved ones to wonder he has provided truth he will inspire an upward reach and his outstretched arms will embrace you jesus promises to one and all who grieve i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you16 there is only one source of true peace i am certain that the lord who notes the fall of a sparrow looks with compassion upon those who have been called upon to parteven temporarilyfrom their precious children the gifts of healing and of peace are desperately needed and jesus through his atonement has provided them for one and all the prophet joseph smith spoke inspired words of revelation and comfort all children who die before they arrive at the years of accountability are saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven17 the mother and father who laid down their little children being deprived of the privilege the joy and the satisfaction of bringing them up to manhood or womanhood in this world would after the resurrection have all the joy satisfaction and pleasure and even more than it would have been possible to have had in mortality in seeing their children grow to the full measure of the stature of their spirits18 this is as the balm of gilead to those who grieve to those who have loved and lost precious children the psalmist provided this assurance weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning19 said the lord peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you that where i am there ye may be also20 i express my profound thanks to a loving heavenly father who gives to you to me and to all who sincerely seek the knowledge that death is not the end that his soneven our savior jesus christdied that we might live temples of the lord dot the lands of many countries sacred covenants are made celestial glory awaits the obedient families can be togetherforever the master invites one and all come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls21 that all may do so is my humble prayer of thanks in the name of jesus christ amen notes luke 171119 ps 3012 2
