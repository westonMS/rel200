parents in zion by president boyd k packer acting president of the quorum of the twelve apostles imagepresident boyd k packer i do want to encourage leaders to carefully consider the home lest they issue calls or schedule activities which place an unnecessary burden on parents and families in 1831 the lord gave a revelation to parents in zion1 it is about parents that i wish to speak i have served in the quorum of the twelve for 28 years and 9 years as an assistant to the twelve put together that makes 37 yearsexactly half my life but i have another calling which i have held even longer i am a parenta father and a grandfather it took years to earn the grandfather titleanother 20 years the title of greatgrandfather these titlesfather grandfather mother grandmothercarry responsibility and an authority which comes in part from experience experience is a compelling teacher my calling in the priesthood defines my position in the church the title grandfather my position in the family i want to talk about both of them together parenthood stands among the most important activities to which latterday saints may devote themselves many members face conflicts as they struggle to balance their responsibility as parents together with faithful activity in the church there are things vital to the wellbeing of a family which can be found only by going to church there is the priesthood which empowers a man to lead and bless his wife and children and covenants which bind them together forever the church was commanded to meet together often2 and told when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other3 mosiah and alma gave the same instruction to their people4 we are commanded to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers5 the lord addressed joseph smith jr by name and said you have not kept the commandments and must needs stand rebuked6 he had failed to teach his children that is the only time the word rebuke is used in correcting him his counselor frederick g williams was under the same condemnation you have not taught your children light and truth7 sidney rigdon was told the same thing as was bishop newel k whitney8 and the lord added what i say unto one i say unto all9 we have watched the standards of morality sink ever lower until now they are in a free fall at the same time we have seen an outpouring of inspired guidance for parents and for families the whole of the curriculum and all of the activities of the church have been restructured and correlated with the home ward teaching became home teaching family home evening was reestablished genealogy was renamed family history and set to collect records of all the families and then the historic proclamation on the family was issued by the first presidency and the council of the twelve apostles the family became and remains a prevailing theme in meetings conferences and councils all as a prelude to an unprecedented era of building temples wherein the authority to seal families together forever is exercised can you see the spirit of inspiration resting upon the servants of the lord and upon parents can we understand the challenge and the assault now leveled at the family in providing outofhome activities for the family we must use care otherwise we could be like a father determined to provide everything for his family he devotes every energy to that end and succeeds only then does he discover that what they needed most to be together as a family has been neglected and he reaps sorrow in place of contentment how easy it is in our desire to provide schedules of programs and activities to overlook the responsibilities of the parent and the essential need for families to have time together we must be careful lest programs and activities of the church become too heavy for some families to carry the principles of the gospel where understood and applied strengthen and protect both individuals and families devotion to the family and devotion to the church are not different and separate things i recently saw a woman respond when it was said of another since she had the new baby she isnt doing anything in the church you could almost see a baby in her arms as she protested with emotion she is doing something in the church she gave that baby life she nurtures and teaches it she is doing the most important thing that she can do in the church how would you respond to this question because of their handicapped child she is confined to the home and he works two jobs to meet the extra expenses they seldom attendcan we count them as active in the church and have you ever heard a woman say my husband is a very good father but hes never been a bishop or a stake president or done anything important in the church in response to that a father vigorously said what is more important in the church than being a good father faithful attendance at church together with careful attention to the needs of the family is a nearperfect combination in church we are taught the great plan of happiness10 at home we apply what we have learned every call every service in the church brings experience and valuable insights which carry over into family life would our perspective be more clear if we could for a moment look upon parenthood as a calling in the church actually it is so much more than that but if we could look at it that way for a moment we could reach a better balance in the way we schedule families i do not want anyone to use what i say to excuse them in turning down an inspired call from the lord i do want to encourage leaders to carefully consider the home lest they issue calls or schedule activities which place an unnecessary burden on parents and families recently i read a letter from a young couple whose callings in the church frequently require them to hire a sitter for their small children in order for them to attend their meetings it has become very difficult for both of them to be home with their children at the same time can you see something out of balance there every time you schedule a youngster you schedule a familyparticularly the mother consider the mother who in addition to her own church calling and that of her husband must get her children ready and run from one activity to another some mothers become discouragedeven depressed i receive letters using the word guilt because they cannot do it all attending church is or should be a respite from the pressures of everyday life it should bring peace and contentment if it brings pressure and discouragement then something is out of balance and the church is not the only responsibility parents have other agencies have a very legitimate reason to call upon the resources of the familyschools employers communityall need to be balanced in recently a mother told me her family had moved from a rural scattered ward where of necessity activities were consolidated into one weekday night it was wonderful they had time for their family i can see them sitting around the table together they moved west into a larger ward where members were closer to the chapel she said now our family is scheduled tuesday night wednesday night thursday night friday night saturday night and sunday night it is very hard on our family remember when you schedule a youngster you schedule a familyparticularly the mother most families try very hard but some when burdened with problems of health and finance simply become exhausted trying to keep up and eventually they withdraw into inactivity they do not see that they are moving from the one best source of light and truth of help with their family into the shadows where danger and heartbreak await i must touch upon what must surely be the most difficult problem to solve some youngsters receive very little teaching and support at home there is no question but that we must provide for them but if we provide a constant schedule of outofhome activities sufficient to compensate for the loss in those homes it may make it difficult for attentive parents to have time to be with and teach their own children only prayer and inspiration can lead us to find this difficult balance we often hear we must provide frequent and exciting activities lest our youth will go to less wholesome places some of them will but i have the conviction that if we teach parents to be responsible and allow them sufficient time over the long course their children will be at home there at home they can learn what cannot be effectively taught in either church or school at home they can learn to work and to take responsibility they learn what to do when they have children of their own for example in the church children are taught the principle of tithing but it is at home that the principle is applied at home even young children can be shown how to figure a tithe and how it is paid one time president and sister harold b lee were in our home sister lee put a handful of pennies on a table before our young son she had him slide the shiny ones to one side and said these are your tithing these belong to the lord the others are yours to keep he thoughtfully looked from one pile to the other and then said dont you have any more dirty ones that was when the real teaching moment began the ward council is the perfect place to establish the balance between home and church here the brethren of the priesthood themselves fathers and sisters of the auxiliaries themselves mothers can with inspired insight coordinate the work of the organizations each of which serves different members of the family members of the council can compare what each organization is providing for each member and how much time and money is required they can unite rather than divide families and provide watch care over single parents the childless the unmarried the elderly the handicappedand provide much more than just activities for the children and young people the ward council has resources often overlooked for instance grandparents while not filling callings can help young families who are finding their way along the same path they once walked the lord warned parents inasmuch as parents have children in zion that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance faith in christ the son of the living god and of baptism and the gift of the holy ghost by the laying on of the hands when eight years old the sin be upon the heads of the parents11 the ward council is ideal for our present need here the home and the family can be anchored in place and the church can support rather than supplant the parents fathers and mothers will understand both their obligation to teach their children and the blessings provided by the church as the world grows ever more threatening the powers of heaven draw ever closer to families and parents i have studied much in the scriptures and have taught from them i have read much from what the prophets and apostles have spoken they have had a profound influence upon me as a man and as a father but most of what i know about how our father in heaven really feels about us his children i have learned from the way i feel about my wife and my children and their children this i have learned at home i have learned it from my parents and from my wifes parents from my beloved wife and from my children and can therefore testify of a loving heavenly father and of a redeeming lord in the name of jesus christ amen notes dc 6825 dc 2075 dc 438 see mosiah 1825 alma 66 mal 46 see also 3 ne 2556
