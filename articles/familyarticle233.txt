cultivating divine attributes by elder joseph b wirthlin of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder joseph b wirthlin we will attain new levels of spirituality and place our lives in closer harmony with jesus the christ based on how fully faith hope and charity become integral components of our lives we often mark significant dates on our calendars such as holidays and birthdays dates that come around every year help us measure progress in our lives one annual event new years day is a time of reflection and resolution our baptism date which commemorates our spiritual rebirth is an annual occasion worthy of special note we pause to recognize the date of our temple sealing as a special anniversary because that ordinance binds us together forever with our most cherished loved ones worthiness interviews especially annual temple recommend interviews give us another opportunity to review our progress in fulfilling the glorious stewardship our father in heaven has given each of us certainly we must watch over and care for our own souls on these occasions we renew covenants affirm commitments and establish eternal goals a few significant events occur only once in a lifetime for example in less than 15 months454 days to be precisewe will experience a new years day when all four numerals in the calendar year will change at the same time public opinion polls indicate that this singular calendar change is looming increasingly large in the public consciousness surveys show that people are anticipating the moment with a very positive outlook one forecaster said that the millennial calendar change will be a profound milestone in peoples lives an opportunity to stop and start anew1 the saviors mortal ministry the birth of the savior into mortality is an event of immeasurable significance that occurred almost 2000 years ago in much of the world calendar years are numbered forward and backward from the entire time of his birth he taught the gospel of repentance and organized his church atoned for the sins of all mankind and was crucified he was resurrected opening the way for all to overcome death and have our sins forgiven if we repent his teachings established standards of human behavior that will endure eternally the second coming of the savior perhaps in an effort to escape the challenges of our times a few voices proclaim that the second coming of the savior is imminent perhaps but the lord could not have been more plain when he said of his triumphal return to the earth but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only2 he taught this truth on the mount of olives and repeated it in modern revelation through the prophet joseph smith with the words the hour and the day no man knoweth3 yes the time will come when christ will reign personally upon the earth4 certainly we are closer to that time now than in 1831 when the lord admonished the elders of the church to labor in my vineyard for the last timefor the last time call upon the inhabitants of the earth for the great millennium of which i have spoken by the mouth of my servants shall come5 we do not know the precise time of the second coming of the savior but we do know that we are living in the latter days and are closer to the second coming than when the savior lived his mortal life in the meridian of time we should resolve to begin a new era of personal obedience to prepare for his return mortality is fleeting we all have much to accomplish in preparation to meet him as latterday saints we believe all things we hope all things if there is anything virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy we seek after these things6 what do we believe that will motivate us to move forward what do we hope for what are the virtuous lovely or praiseworthy things we should seek after i believe we should strive to develop within ourselves the traits of the character of the savior faith hope and charity the words of the apostle paul come to mind and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity7 these divine attributes should become fixed in our hearts and minds to guide us in all of our actions we read in moroni cleave unto charity which is the greatest of all whoso is found possessed of it at the last day it shall be well with him8 charity can be the outward expression of faith and hope if sought and obtained these three foundation elements of celestial character will abide with us in this life and beyond the veil into the next life remember that the same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that you go out of this life will have power to possess your body in the eternal world9 we should not wait a single day to intensify our personal efforts to strengthen these virtuous lovely and praiseworthy attributes when we keep the lords commandments faith hope and charity abide with us these virtues distil upon our soul as the dews from heaven10 and we prepare ourselves to stand with confidence before our lord and savior jesus christ without blemish and without spot11 as i read and ponder the scriptures i see that developing faith hope and charity within ourselves is a stepbystep process faith begets hope and together they foster charity we read in moroni wherefore there must be faith and if there must be faith there must also be hope and if there must be hope there must also be charity12 these three virtues may be sequential initially but once obtained they become interdependent each one is incomplete without the others they support and reinforce each other moroni explained and except ye have charity ye can in nowise be saved in the kingdom of god neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of god if ye have not faith neither can ye if ye have no hope13 these are the virtuous lovely praiseworthy characteristics we seek we all are familiar with pauls teaching that charity never faileth14 certainly we need unfailing spiritual strength in our lives moroni recorded the revelation that faith hope and charity bringeth us unto the lordthe fountain of all righteousness15 the church of jesus christ of latterday saints the restored church of the lord on the earth today guides us to the savior and helps us develop nurture and strengthen these divine attributes in fact he revealed the qualifications required to labor in his service in these words no one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love having faith hope and charity16 mormon taught that charity is the pure love of christ and exhorted us to pray unto the father with all the energy of heart that we may be filled with this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his son jesus christ17 note that charity is given only to those who seek it only to those who earnestly pray for it only to those who are disciples of christ before we can be filled with this pure love we must start at the beginning with the first principle of the gospel we must have first faith in the lord jesus christ18 faith now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen19 faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things therefore if we have faith we hope for things which are not seen which are true20 latterday saints can rejoice in the strength of our faith because we have the fulness of the gospel if we study ponder and pray our faith in the unseen but true things of god will grow even if we start with only a particle of faith even if we can no more than desire to believe21 with nurturing attention a tiny seed of faith can grow into a vibrant strong fruitful tree of testimony faith in the lord jesus christ motivates us to repent through repentance made possible by the lords atonement we can feel the calming peace of forgiveness for our sins weaknesses and mistakes with faith in a spiritual rebirth we are baptized and receive the gift of the holy ghost we strive to keep the commandments of god with faith that obedience will help us become like him by virtue of the resurrection of our savior we have faith that death is not the end of life we have faith that we once again will know the pleasant company and warm embrace of loved ones who have departed from mortality hope mormon asked the saints of his day and what is it that ye shall hope for he gave them this answer behold i say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of christ and the power of his resurrection to be raised unto life eternal and this because of your faith in him according to the promise22 in ether we learn that whoso believeth in god might with surety hope for a better world yea even a place at the right hand of god which hope cometh of faith and maketh an anchor to the souls of men23 even when the winds of adversity blow our father keeps us anchored to our hope the lord has promised i will not leave you comfortless24 and he will consecrate our afflictions for our gain25 even when our trials seem overwhelming we can draw strength and hope from the sure promise of the lord be not afraid nor dismayed for the battle is not yours but gods26 charity once faith grows into a firm abiding testimony giving us hope in our heavenly fathers plan of happiness once we see through the eye of faith that we are children of a loving father who has given us the gift of his son to redeem us we experience a mighty change in our hearts27 we feel to sing the song of redeeming love28 and our hearts overflow with charity knowing that the love of god is the most desirable of all things and the most joyous to the soul29 we want to share our joy with others we want to serve them and bless them family the family a proclamation to the world states clearly the sacredness of the family and that a husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children30 children should be taught at an early age of the sacredness of temples and that their ultimate goal should be to go to the temple to enjoy the blessings that our heavenly father has in store for them even the tapestry of this sacred goal is given to children that will in due time realize this is the greatest blessing that could come to them in this life temples the ideals of faith hope and charity are most evident in the holy temples there we learn the purpose of life strengthen our commitment as disciples of christ by entering into sacred covenants with him and seal our families together for eternity across generations receiving our own endowment in a temple and returning frequently to perform sacred ordinances for our kindred dead increases our faith strengthens our hope and deepens our charity we receive our own endowment with faith and hope that we will understand the lords plan for his children will recognize the divine potential within each of us as children of our heavenly father and will be faithful to the end in keeping the covenants we make performing temple ordinances for the dead is a manifestation of charity offering essential blessings to those who have preceded us blessings that were not available to them during their mortal lives we have the privilege of doing for them what they are unable to do for themselves when president gordon b hinckley announced an unprecedented number of new temples last april he declared that temple ordinances become the crowning blessings the church has to offer31 he is extending these crowning blessings to more latterday saints than ever before in the house of the lord faithful church members can be endowed with power from on high32 power that will enable us to resist temptation honor covenants obey the lords commandments and bear fervent fearless testimony of the gospel to family friends and neighbors this past july we were privileged to participate with president hinckley in the dedication of the monticello utah temple the first of the new generation of temples that the lord has directed our prophet to have built closer to the saints what a great spiritual experience that was to be among faithful saints who never expected that a temple would be built in their town these are people of great faith some of them are descendants of the holeintherock pioneers who struggled labored and sacrificed through many years of toil to establish zion on the high plateaus of southeastern utah33 brothers and sisters great things are happening in the church we are moving forward as never before president hinckleys leadership is challenging us to rise to the occasion we will attain new levels of spirituality and place our lives in closer harmony with jesus the christ based on how fully faith hope and charity become integral components of our lives we surely will have challenges and trials but with more assurance than ever we will have greater peace and joy for he promised us his peace34 testimony i testify to you as a special witness that jesus is the christ and that through his prophet president gordon b hinckley the savior presides over his church may we cultivate in preparation of his returning to this earth his divine attributes is my prayer in the name of jesus christ amen notes outlook nfo
