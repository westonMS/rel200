come listen to a prophets voice by virginia u jensen first counselor in the relief society general presidency imagevirginia u jensen if we listen to the voice of the lord through his living prophet and follow his counsel we will never go astray one evening when i was 11 years old i heard a commotion outside my window i looked out the window and in the street were newsboys carrying stacks of newspapers in their arms announcing the news that president george albert smith the eighth president of the church had died president smith had been the only prophet i had known in my short time on earth it was during his administration that i first felt the stirrings of a testimony and even then i knew how important gods prophets are i had been taught in primary and in my home by loving parents that president smith was our earthly link to our heavenly father and his son jesus christ that they could talk to me through him what an empowering concept for a young girl the spirit had confirmed in my 11yearold mind that this was true when i learned of his death i felt a tremendous loss however just five days after president smiths death president david o mckay stood in this tabernacle and spoke to those assembled he had just been unanimously sustained as the prophet seer and revelator by the saints as he brushed back the tears he said no one can preside over the church without first being in tune with the head of the church our lord and savior jesus christ he is our head this is his church with his guidance with his inspiration we cannot fail1 i quickly came to love and revere president mckay just as i had loved and revered president smith in fact i remember seeing him stand at this pulpit with his white hair gleaming and thinking he looked just like an angel prophets ancient and modern were and are giants of the lord chosen and ordained before they came to this earth our prophets are men whom the lord has raised up specifically to preside over the church for the particular time in which they have served the lord is working through the leaders of his church today just as he has always done in the past president wilford woodruff said if we had before us every revelation which god ever gave to man and they were piled up here a hundred feet high the church and kingdom of god could not grow in this or any other age of the world without the living oracles of god2 brothers and sisters listen to the instructions and promise found in the doctrine and covenants wherefore thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them walking in all holiness before me for his word ye shall receive as if from mine own mouth in all patience and faith dc 2145 the lords will to abraham was not sufficient for the people of moses time the will of the lord to moses was not sufficient for the people of isaiahs time different dispensations required different instructions that is true today the dispensation in which we now live is a dispensation into which the knowledge of all other dispensations of the gospel have merged what a blessing it is for us to live in this time when the fulness of the gospel is ours to bless our lives i would like to extend to all within the sound of my voice today an invitation previously written in a hymn come listen to a prophets voice and hear the word of god hymns no 21 every member of the church of any age or circumstance will be touched and blessed by the inspired counsel of prophets of the lord the story is told of an event that happened in new york when president david o mckay returned from a trip to europe arrangements had been made for pictures to be taken but the regular photographer was unable to go so in desperation the united press picked their crime photographera man accustomed to the toughest type of work in new york he went to the airport stayed there two hours and returned later from the dark room with a tremendous sheaf of pictures he was supposed to take only two his boss immediately chided him what in the world are you wasting time and all those photographic supplies for the photographer replied very curtly saying he would gladly pay for the extra materials and they could even dock him for the extra time he took several hours later the vicepresident called him to his office wanting to learn what happened the crime photographer said when i was a little boy my mother used to read to me out of the old testament and all my life i have wondered what a prophet of god must really look like well today i found one3 do we fully appreciate what a wondrous blessing it is to each one of us that we have found our prophet the ways in which our lives have been enriched by listening to our prophets voice are numerous we have a clearer picture of who we are and what we mean to our father in heaven we have received commandments and counsel to guide us reminders to keep us on the straight and narrow and encouraging words to spur us on when we become disheartened or discouraged if we listen to the voices of the world we will be misled but if we listen to the voice of the lord through his living prophet and follow his counsel we will never go astray in a recent newspaper article president hinckley was praised as clearly a man for the season hes a hand shaker a praiser a man who knows what to say and how to say it often with a sense of humor4 brothers and sisters those are just the things the general public sees we as members of the church see so much more through the whisperings of the holy spirit we know that the true head of this church the lord jesus christ does communicate with us through president hinckley it was my blessing and privilege to feel that spirit when i was called into president hinckleys office to receive my call to the general relief society presidency one and a half years ago before i knew the purpose of my being there i shook his hand and received a powerful personal witness that i was in the presence of a prophet of god that witness made me feel exceedingly humble and reverent if i was kind of quiet that day president hinckley that is the reason we are so blessed to have a living prophet who makes connections that have never been made before joseph smith made this prophecy in the dedication of the kirtland temple that thy church may come forth out of the wilderness of darkness and shine forth fair as the moon clear as the sun and terrible as an army with banners dc 10973 president hinckley has been prepared for our day for a mediasavvy world outside the windows of our lives are many voices announcing the death of honesty the death of integrity the death of goodness and righteousness even announcing the death of the traditional family how blessed we are as latterday saints to know that god can speak to us through our living prophet today and give us guidance and instruction and encouragement so that we may continue just as the lords true church continues steadfast and confident on the path that leads us back to him there arent many guarantees in this life there isnt a car made with a warranty that covers everything no bank on earth can absolutely guarantee that your money is completely safe even the good housekeeping seal of approval has a disclaimer written right on it nothing manmade or mancontrolled can ever be truly guaranteed but heres the miracle the lord has given some marvelous guarantees without any disclaimers and this is one of them he will choose the prophet and he will never let that man lead us astray imagine for a moment the impact of that promise there is at least one place we can turn for pure unpolluted guidance as sisters in relief society it is our work under the direction of the priesthood to assist in bringing women and their families back to heavenly father to live with him again as we all did before we came to this earth the voice of a living prophet bearing gods message is clear and sure and safe and direct gods message was never more clear and sure or safe and direct than when president gordon b hinckley read as part of his message at the general relief society meeting held september 23 1995 the proclamation on the family5 look at the lessons god taught a floundering world through this proclamation marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of god we are created in his image our gender was determined before we came to earth and is part of our eternal identity we lived with him before we came to earth god commanded us to bear children but warned that the powers of procreation were to be employed only within the sacred bonds of marriage god tells us through his prophet that we have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other as husband and wife and to rear our children in love and righteousness to provide for their physical and spiritual needs the family is ordained of god parents have specific duties and responsibilitiesfathers preside provide and protect and mothers nurture in addition the proclamation contains this very important warningthat those who abuse spouse or offspring who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will stand accountable before god further this warningthat the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals communities and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets brothers and sisters we are in the midst of that reality at this very moment it is the duty of all of us to protect and strengthen the family i invite you again to come listen to a prophets voice the prophet joseph smith established relief society as a result of a revelation from god so that knowledge and intelligence shall flow down from this time henceforth joseph smith promised you will receive instructions through the order of the priesthood which god has established through the medium of those appointed to lead guide and direct the affairs of the church in this last dispensation6 in relief society we are taught ways to protect and strengthen the family president hinckley has said the best lies ahead if you will stay on the straight and narrow the best lies ahead it is a wonderful time to be alive its a great time to be a member of this church when you can hold your head up without embarrassment and with some pride in this great latterday work7 come listen to a prophets voice that you may know the will of god that you may have his light to direct your path it is my prayer that you may also have a personal witness as i have that our living prophet today president gordon b hinckley has soulsaving instructions for you and yoursinstructions that if followed will lead us all back to our heavenly home safe and unspotted from the world i say these things in the sacred name of jesus christ amen
