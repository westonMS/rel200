tearstained face i looked up at her and said oh i know youll be back but who is going to mop the kitchen floor while youre gone i think thats called turning your heart to yourself i soon discovered it was more than having the floor mopped that i would miss we need each other we need to stand by each other a few years later this same older sister turned her heart to me when i asked her if i could borrow her car to go visit my friends she agreed but said that i needed to have it back by four oclock i happily took off we were having such a good time i could hardly believe it when i looked at the clock and it was six oclock when i ran into the house my sister wasnt there but on the table was a beautiful chocolate cake my favorite with a note that said dont worry i know you were having a good

had heard about she said to the worried parents let me just try putting brielle in with her sister to see if that helps the parents consented and the nurse slipped the squirming baby into the incubator with the bigger sister no sooner had the door of the incubator closed than brielle snuggled up to kyrie and calmed right down within minutes brielles bloodoxygen readings were the best they
