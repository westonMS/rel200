understanding our true identity by carol b thomas first counselor in the young women general presidency imagecarol b thomas long ago you and i were born as daughters in our heavenly fathers family each one of you was a valiant and noble woman in your premortal life familywhat a sacred name for those we love the most if someone asked you to name the greatest thing about your family what would it be i know that most families including mine are not perfect but every day we are trying to be more kind and thoughtful to each other this past month my father died i learned many lessons from my dad he had such great faith he said dying is just like walking into another room the day he died i thought my dad died today this was his last day on earth he has just walked into another room it was such a sweet sacred experience for my family and me it was my father who taught me about the premortal life he explained that long ago you and i were born as daughters in our heavenly fathers family we made sacred decisions there that have influenced what we are doing now when i was younger my grandfather gave me a blessing he blessed me that i would continue my ministry here that i had so nobly performed there now if i had a ministry in the premortal existence then so did you it is not by chance that you were born now in this season of the worlds history each one of you was a valiant and noble woman in your premortal life abraham said now the lord had shown unto me abraham the intelligences that were organized before the world was and among all these were many of the noble and great ones abr 322 do you know that he was talking about you you are each noble and great born to live at this time on the earth we all come from many different kinds of families some of you are doing hard things and you are doing them so very well some of you may worry about your relationships with your mother or father as you learn together how to live in families you are learning that sometimes the savior calms the storm sometimes he lets the storm rage and calms you paraphrasing what elder jeffrey r holland once said the home is not a monastery for perfect people sometimes it is a hospital where we nurse and take care of those we love see he hath filled the hungry with good things ensign nov 1997 66 one young woman wrote every person in my family has hard times but i try to be there for them and help them out we want to be together for all eternity we are so impressed that each of you young women is turning your heart to your family one young woman scatters sunshine wherever she goes she writes i help my family by making them laugh when they are sad i try to make them happy again another young woman said since i live in a family of nonmembers myself included i think that my service is being an example of a young woman trying to live the gospel i bring to my house little by little the blessings and the good feelings that i receive from the one true church in africa two young women from ghana who are sisters sing the beautiful songs of zion bringing a spirit of peace to their own family sometimes young women have special challenges when the family isnt complete last summer in alaska i met a young women president whose mother had died when she was three she had been raised by her father joining the church at age 14 i asked her how she had learned to do all the feminine things like fixing her hair and setting a pretty table she said i watched my young women leaders when i saw one of them who knew how to cook i thought i want to be just like her now every time i clean my house i think of my laurel adviser so even if your own families are less than perfect you can think about and plan for your own future family as each one of you practices being a homemaker you are doing exactly what the lord wants you to do in every young womans heart is a deep yearning to someday be a wife and a mother these feelings were nurtured in your soul long before you came to this earth president hinckley has said women for the most part see their greatest fulfillment their greatest happiness in home and family teachings of gordon b hinckley 1997 387 turning hearts to the family the 1998 worldwide celebration suggests so many ways you can turn your hearts to your families including to your ancestors the spirit of elijah is with young women throughout the world there are family history centers places where you can find your ancestors and your roots young women love doing this one young woman writes when we first went to the family history center we didnt want to go it sounded so boring but i got excited when i found the name of my greatgreatgrandmother on the computer as you search for your ancestors and desire to do their temple work you know the power that comes from attending the house of the lord martha milanes a young women leader from colombia wrote our temple will soon be dedicated and what a glorious experience it will be to watch all of our young women doing the baptismal work for their ancestors the celebration is so inspired that i am also willing to turn my own heart to my family this will be our offering to the lord at his temple here in colombia thank you young women for all you offer as you continue to enjoy this worldwide celebration you will feel strengthened by the power of the spirit as you pray and read your scriptures and keep the commandments the holy ghost will whisper to you that you belong to heavenly fathers royal family and that he loves you very much of this i testify in the name of jesus christ amen
