great love for our fathers children by elder quentin l cook of the quorum of the twelve apostles love is the primary attribute and motive for the spiritual purposes we were charged to undertake by our beloved prophet my dear brothers and sisters this is a unique and pivotal time in history we are blessed to live in the last dispensation before the second coming of the savior near the commencement of this dispensation in 1829 the year before the church was formally organized a beloved revelation was received declaring that a marvelous work was about to come forth this revelation established that those who desired to serve god qualify for such service through faith hope charity and love with an eye single to the glory of god1 charity which is the pure love of christ2 includes gods eternal love for all his children3 my purpose this morning is to emphasize the essential role of that kind of love in missionary work temple and family history work and homecentered churchsupported family religious observance love of the savior and love of our fellow men and women4 is the primary attribute and motive for ministering and the spiritual purposes5 we were charged to undertake by our beloved prophet president russell m nelson in the adjustments announced in 2018 missionary effort to gather scattered israel i was exposed to the relationship between missionary work and love early in my life when i was 11 years old i received a patriarchal blessing from a patriarch who was also my grandfather6 that blessing said in part i bless you with great love for your fellowmen for thou shalt be called to carry the gospel to the world to win souls unto christ7 i understood even at that early age that sharing the gospel was based on a great love for all our heavenly fathers children as general authorities assigned to work on preach my gospel 15 years ago we concluded that the attribute of love was essential to missionary work in our day just as it has always been chapter 6 on christlike attributes including charity and love has consistently been the most popular chapter among missionaries as emissaries of the savior most missionaries feel this kind of love and when they do their efforts are blessed when members gain a vision of this kind of love which is essential in assisting the lord in his purpose the lords work will be accomplished imager wayne shute i was privileged to have a small role in a marvelous example of this kind of love when i was serving as president of the pacific islands area i received a call from president r wayne shute as a young man he served a mission in samoa later he returned to samoa as a mission president8 when he telephoned me he was the apia samoa temple president one of his young missionaries when he was mission president was elder o vincent haleck who is now the area president in the pacific president shute had great love and respect for vince and the entire haleck family most of the family were members of the church but vinces father otto haleck the patriarch of the family of german and samoan descent was not a member president shute knew i was attending a stake conference and other meetings in american samoa and he asked me if i would consider staying in otto halecks residence with the view of sharing the gospel with him imageelder o vincent haleck as a young missionary my wife mary and i stayed with otto and his wife dorothy in their beautiful home at breakfast i shared a gospel message and invited otto to meet with the missionaries he was kind but firm in refusing my invitation he said he was pleased that many members of his family were latterday saints but he forcefully indicated that some of his samoan mothers ancestors had been early christian ministers in samoa and he felt a great allegiance to their traditional christian faith9 nevertheless we left as good friends later when president gordon b hinckley was preparing to dedicate the suva fiji temple he had his personal secretary brother don h staheli10 call me in new zealand to make arrangements president hinckley wanted to fly from fiji to american samoa to meet the saints a certain hotel used in a previous visit was suggested i asked if i could make different arrangements brother staheli said you are the area president that would be fine i immediately called president shute and told him that perhaps we had a second chance at spiritually blessing our friend otto haleck this time the missionary would be president gordon b hinckley i asked if he thought it would be appropriate for the halecks to host all of us in president hinckleys travel group11 president and sister hinckley their daughter jane and elder and sister jeffrey r holland were also part of the travel group president shute working with the family made all the arrangements12 when we arrived from fiji after the temple dedication we were warmly greeted13 we spoke that evening to thousands of samoan members and then proceeded to the haleck family compound when we gathered for breakfast the next morning president hinckley and otto haleck had already become good friends it was interesting to me that they were having much the same conversation i had had with otto more than a year earlier when otto expressed his admiration for our church but reaffirmed his commitment to his existing church president hinckley put his hand on ottos shoulder and said otto thats not good enough you ought to be a member of the church this is the lords church you figuratively could see the resistive armor fall away from otto with an openness to what president hinckley said this was the beginning of additional missionary teaching and a spiritual humility that allowed otto haleck to be baptized and confirmed a little over a year later one year after that the haleck family was sealed as an eternal family in the temple14 imagehaleck family sealed in the temple what touched my heart throughout this incredible experience was the overwhelming ministering love exhibited by president wayne shute for his former missionary elder vince haleck and his desire to see the entire haleck family united as an eternal family15 when it comes to gathering israel we need to align our hearts with this kind of love and move away from feelings of mere responsibility16 or guilt to feelings of love and participation in the divine partnership of sharing the saviors message ministry and mission with the world17 as members we can show our love for the savior and our brothers and sisters throughout the world by making simple invitations the new sunday meeting schedule represents an exceptional opportunity for members to successfully and lovingly invite friends and associates to come and see and feel a church experience18 a spiritual sacrament meeting hopefully as sacred as what elder jeffrey r holland described yesterday will be followed by a 50minute meeting focused on the new testament and the savior or relevant conference addresses also focused on the savior and his doctrine some relief society sisters have wondered why they have been given a gathering assignment along with priesthood quorum members there are reasons for this and president nelson set forth many of them in the last general conference he concluded we simply cannot gather israel without you19 in our day we are blessed that approximately 30 percent of our fulltime missionaries are sisters this provides additional incentive for relief society sisters to lovingly share the gospel what is needed is a loving compassionate spiritual commitment by each of usmen women youth and childrento share the gospel of jesus christ if we show love kindness and humility many will accept our invitation those who choose not to accept our invitation will still be our friends temple and family history effort to gather israel love is also at the center of our temple and family history effort to gather israel on the other side of the veil when we learn of the trials and hardships our ancestors faced our love and appreciation for them is magnified our temple and family history effort has been strengthened to a significant degree by the new adjustments in both the sunday meeting schedule and the youth advancement in classes and quorums these changes provide for earlier and more powerful attention to learning about our ancestors and gathering israel on the other side of the veil both temple and family history work are greatly enhanced the internet is a powerful tool the home is now our primary family history center our young members are exceptionally skilled in family history research and are spiritually motivated to perform baptisms for their ancestors whom they have learned to love and appreciate since the change allowing many 11yearolds to perform baptisms for the dead temple presidents across the world report greatly increased attendance one temple president informs us that there has been a remarkable increase in baptismal patrons and the addition of 11yearolds brings more families even at their young age they appear to sense reverence and purpose for the ordinance they are performing it is beautiful to watch20 i know our primary and youth leaders are making and will continue to make family history and temple work a major effort relief society sisters and priesthood brethren can lovingly help fulfill their temple and family history responsibility individually and also by assisting and inspiring children and youth to gather israel on the other side of the veil this is particularly important in the home and on the sabbath i promise that lovingly performing ordinances for ancestors will strengthen and protect our youth and families in a world that is becoming increasingly evil i also personally testify that president russell m nelson has received profoundly important revelations relating to temples and temple work prepare eternal families and individuals to live with god the new emphasis on homecentered gospel study and living and the resources that are provided by the church are a great opportunity for lovingly preparing eternal families and individuals to meet and live with god21 when a man and woman are sealed in the temple they enter the holy order of matrimony in the new and everlasting covenant an order of the priesthood22 together they obtain and receive priesthood blessings and power to direct the affairs of their family women and men have unique roles as outlined in the family a proclamation to the world23 but their stewardships are equal in value and importance24 they have equal power to receive revelation for their family when they work together in love and righteousness their decisions are heaven blessed those who seek to know the will of the lord as individuals and for their families must strive for righteousness meekness kindness and love humility and love are the hallmark of those who seek the lords will especially for their families perfecting ourselves qualifying ourselves for the blessings of covenants and preparing to meet god are individual responsibilities we need to be selfreliant and anxiously engaged in making our homes a refuge from the storms that surround us25 and a sanctuary of faith26 parents have a responsibility to lovingly teach their children homes filled with love are a joy a delight and a literal heaven on earth27 my mothers favorite hymn was love at home28 whenever she heard the first phrase there is beauty all around when theres love at home she became visibly touched and teary as children we were aware that we lived in that kind of home it was one of her highest priorities29 in addition to encouraging a loving atmosphere in the home president nelson has focused on limiting media use that disrupts our primary purposes30 one adjustment that will benefit almost any family is to make the internet social media and television a servant instead of a distraction or even worse a master the war for the souls of all but particularly children is often in the home as parents we need to make sure that media content is wholesome age appropriate and consistent with the loving atmosphere we are trying to create teaching in our homes needs to be clear and compelling31 but also spiritual joyful and full of love i promise that as we focus on our love for the savior and his atonement make him the centerpiece of our efforts to gather israel on both sides of the veil minister to others and individually prepare to meet god the influence of the adversary will be diminished and the joy delight and peace of the gospel will magnify our homes with christlike love32 i testify of these doctrinal promises and bear a sure witness of jesus christ and his atoning sacrifice in our behalf in the name of jesus christ amen notes
