over the world from asia to africa from new zealand to norway the wonderful young women of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints are turning hearts to the family its a worldwide celebration of families this whole year we know that families are a vital part of heavenly fathers plan for his children this is explained in the document the family a proclamation to the world i remember so well when that proclamation was presented it was very impressive to me on september 23 1995 the women of the church were gathered in a great general relief society meeting our prophet president gordon b hinckley stood to speak to us as part of his talk he read for the first time a document called the family a proclamation to the world in this proclamation we are taught again by the first presidency and the quorum of the twelve apostles that heavenly father has a plan for his children and that families are the central part of that plan it is vital then that we strengthen these families which are so very important in the sight of god you young women have an important role to play in at least three families the first is the family you are part of now the second is your future family and the third is the heavenly family of which we are all part let us consider our place in each of these three families first lets consider the family you are growing up in now when i think about the family i grew up in i remember how my little sister and i shared the bedroom and the piano and washing dishes i remember getting the giggles with my brother at suppertime and we laughed so hard we had to be sent away from the table until we quit oh you learn a lot of things in a family dont you and theyre important thingsthings like praying and sharing and laughing and loving and working and getting along with others how thankful i am for all the important lessons of life that i learned in my family many of you young women have written and shared with us your family experiences and some of the things you are learning as you have turned your hearts to your families twelveyearold katie quinn wrote my mother was expecting a baby she was bedridden much of the time and all of a sudden there was a ton of responsibility on my shoulders because i am the oldest i was also just starting middle school and had loads of homework i knew i needed to help a lot and i even prayed to know what i should do i felt an answer came when my grandmother who was staying with us for a few weeks told me a story about one of my ancestors who at age 11 had driven a covered wagon by himself across the plains to the salt lake valley his parents had died along the way and he was left to care for four younger sisters including a baby and take them to zion this story made me realize that i could be like my greatgreatgreatgrandfather and push forward i decided it would help my family if i made sack lunches for my sisters or do other duties like folding clothing and ironing and other extra chores i gathered my younger sisters and brother every morning before school and carried on our family scripture reading even though my father had left earlier for work and my mother was too sick to lead us my family grew closer together because we had to help each other the greatest blessing happened on may 1 1997 when hannah ada quinn was born personal letter in authors possession thank you for the letter katie she learned about determination and courage and loyalty to family from her third greatgrandfather who lived so long ago and then she used those qualities as she helped her family who needed her
