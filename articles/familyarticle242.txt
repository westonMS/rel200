the kingdoms perfecting pathway by elder dale e miller of the seventy imageelder dale e miller as we invest our time talents and means to build zion our hearts are purified our wisdom increases celestial habits begin to form the prophet joseph smith spoke of ancient prophets being filled with unspeakable joy when in vision they viewed our day they prophesied they sang they praised and they wrote about this grand culminating clip of time surely god is pouring his spirit in rich abundance upon his earthly kingdom we declare to the world that the lords kingdom is by no means a closed community the lord invites all people to travel this perfecting pathway of divine truth he promises joy and everlasting happiness as the reward the entry fee a broken heart a contrite spirit and a willingness to continue in his footsteps listen to the lords voice on the matter behold i speak unto all who have good desires and have thrust in their sickle to reap behold i am jesus christ the son of god i am the life and the light of the world verily verily i say unto you that as many as receive me to them will i give power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on my name dc 112728 30 brothers and sisters thrusting in our sickles to help build the lords kingdom should be the prime focus of our lives it seems reasonable to suggest that we each agreed to that in our premortal life the key decisions pertaining to education career marriage the very use of our time talent and means should prayerfully hinge on how best we serve the master building his kingdom and becoming perfected in him our work in building up zion takes several forms in one context zion is geographic having a center while enlarging its boundaries to eventually fill the earth we enlarge zions borders as we share the gospel with others that is part of our job here another context shows zion as an organization wherein we work to strengthen its stakes through our callings each stake in turn pushes deep into the gospel soil providing a defense and a refuge so followers of christ might stand with confidence against the snares of the adversary stakes create the foundation culture for perfecting gods people on earth the scriptures suggest that zion has a third context an intensely personal one it is the perfecting process within us those willing to serve are invited to labor in the vineyard of the lord steadily transforming themselves to become the pure in heart the symbiosis between church and member is strikingly efficient as we invest our time talents and means to build zion our hearts are purified our wisdom increases celestial habits begin to form and the holy spirit prepares us to receive the presence of the father and the son by thrusting in our sickle we reap a double portionfor ourselves and for the kingdom therefore of great eternal significance are the introspective questions can i qualify as being pure in heart can i without reservation join the voices of king benjamins congregation who said yea we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us and also we know of their surety and truth because of the spirit of the lord omnipotent which has wrought a mighty change in us or in our hearts that we have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually mosiah 52 if president hinckley were to ask for our response at the conclusion of this conference as did king benjamin to his people could we say that we have felt a mighty change in our hearts has our disposition been strengthened sufficiently to abandon that which displeases god and changed so that we seek to do good continually the lives of those early nephite saints provide powerful visions of our own potential as a church and as individuals the lord works with us on both levels as we move towards perfection it is easy to feel that we fall short we can take confidence that the lord knows us intimately he knows the intent of our hearts he will surely show us the way as we humble ourselves are obedient and work toward continual improvement even now he prepares us in ways that we cant yet see the eyes of our understanding will be opened as we keep the commandments and seek to serve him we have the potential to eventually become perfected in christ this is a divine inheritance as a guide president kimball pointed to three fundamentals in bringing zion into our hearts and presence first we must eliminate the individual tendency to selfishness that snares the soul shrinks the heart and darkens the mind second we must cooperate completely and work in harmony one with the other there must be unanimity in our decisions and unity in our actions third we must lay on the altar and sacrifice whatever is required by the lord we begin by offering a broken heart and contrite spirit we follow this by giving our best effort in our assigned fields of labor and callings we learn our duty and execute it fully finally we consecrate our time talents and means as called upon by our file leaders and as prompted by the whisperings of the spirit in conference report apr 1978 123 the home serves as the great laboratory for practicing and teaching selflessness and i can think of no better prescription than to continually keep before our eyes the counsel given in the document the family a proclamation to the world by the first presidency and council of the twelve apostles just two sentences of this profound counsel create a perfecting pathway within our homes first parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness to provide for their physical and spiritual needs to teach them to love and serve one another to observe the commandments of god and to be lawabiding citizens wherever they live and second happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the lord jesus christ that gives rise to an almost infinite list of family council and home evening topics ensign nov 1995 102 brothers and sisters this kingdom is like no other organization on earth to borrow a business term it has a vastly superior competitive edge it alone will lead us to eternal life it alone is founded on solid rock the rock of revelation it alone has the fully restored gospel of the lord jesus christ at the personal level it instills a purging discipline within us it pushes us out of our circles of comfort into growth it fosters development of great spiritual gifts and enlightenment which we will take with us in the next life it provides the baptism of fire it personally empowers us in ways that can only come from god gratefully and joyfully i am a witness that this is the great kingdom of god on earth as prophesied throughout the ages it is the only true pathway leading us in our journey back to a loving heavenly father having been redeemed through the atonement of his only begotten i so testify in the name of jesus christ amen
