children and the family by elder w eugene hansen of the presidency of the seventy imageelder w eugene hansen strong family relationships dont just happen it takes time it takes commitment it takes prayer and it takes work as we read the scriptures the love of the lord for children is apparent and understandably so children are an heritage of the lord ps 1273 in the new testament the savior made clear the seriousness of anyone causing harm or offending these little ones as recorded in matthew it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea matt 186 one of the most touching scenes recorded in the book of mormonwhich is another testament of jesus christoccurred when the resurrected lord appeared to the nephite people who inhabited the western hemisphere at the time of the savior during that appearance he ministered so tenderly to the little children we read how as he stood in the midst of the multitude he called upon the people to bring forth their little children and he knelt among them and prayed to the father for them the words that he spoke were so sacred that they could not be written he wept and he took the children one by one and blessed them as the multitude looked heavenward they saw the heavens openangels appeared and descended the children were encircled by fire and angels ministered to them as we acknowledge the love the lord has for little children it is not surprising that those who represent the lord on the earth today have spoken out plainly and forcefully as to the responsibility parents have for their children i refer to the document issued by the first presidency and the council of the twelve apostles entitled the family a proclamation to the world from that document we read husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness to provide for their physical and spiritual needs to teach them to love and serve one another to observe the commandments of god and to be lawabiding citizens wherever they live husbands and wivesmothers and fatherswill be held accountable before god for the discharge of these obligations ensign nov 1995 102 these are sobering words particularly in light of the adversarys continuing assault on traditional values and the impact it is having upon the family it becomes obvious that much needs to be done to reverse trends that continue to place the family at risk in desperation society turns to the secular social programs are spawned government agencies are enlisted to provide public funding and programs in an attempt to change the destructive trends while some spotty successes are observed general trends remain alarming i submit that if real and lasting change is to occur it will come only as we return to our spiritual moorings we need to be listening to the counsel of the prophets again the proclamation on the family modernday revelation the family is ordained of god children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the lord jesus christ successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith prayer repentance forgiveness respect love compassion work and wholesome recreational activities by divine design fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children in these sacred responsibilities fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners disability death or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation extended families should lend support when needed as we ponder these inspired words of modern revelation i acknowledge the blessing of being raised in a good home a home where parents were more concerned about the children god gave them than acquiring worldly fame or possessions i was next oldest in a family of eight children we lived on a small farm in northern utah money was scarce and thus i was blessed with the necessity of learning to work at a young age in fact our limited income required all of the children to be frugal and to contribute to the financial success of the family as soon as they were old enough on the subject of loafing my father had a favorite saying theres nothing so boring as loafing because you cant stop and rest although times have changed the principles remain the same todays parents need to give each of their children opportunities to contribute to the wellbeing of the family in such a family children are happier and there is a spirit of love and unity in the home i learned on that little farm that money and material possessions are not the keys to happiness and success of course there must be sufficient to supply basic needs but money in and of itself seldom if ever results in happiness our farm also provided the opportunity for learning humility it seems that if we had a good crop and prices were high an early frost or a hailstorm would manage to trim the income down to where we would barely get by i heard my father remark on more than one occasion i dont mind being educated in the school of hard knocksits the refresher courses i keep getting that are the trial even with the constant financial challenge we still had a good life there was love in the home home was the place where we wanted to be and it was good for us to have had the experience of forgoing some of our wants that others in the family would be able to have their needs fulfilled our living room furniture would never have made the cover of house beautiful but we did have two very significant items we had a piano and we had a bookcase how significant those two somewhat simple possessions were in the development of productive talents and interests so important in our early years the influence of good music and good books carried well over into the next generation even television has not replaced the piano and the bookcase in the lives of our families we were also blessed with a mother and a father who worked as equal partners in that critically important responsibility of raising a family i learned much as i watched them teach their children in the most effective wayby example my father taught me duty and charity as i saw him leave his own work on many occasions to go to the aid of ward members faith as i listened to him pray and observed him give priesthood blessings to family members and others love as i watched him tenderly care for his parents in their older years standards as he used experience and current events to teach me concerning the path that he expected me to follow dependability as he bought me an alarm clock and then assigned me five cows to milk night and morning during my high school years he taught integrity as i can truthfully say i never saw him do a dishonest thing my mother also taught many things she taught thrift as she practiced the spirit of that pioneer adage use it up wear it out make it do or do without sacrifice as i saw her many times go without that her children might have chastity as early on she made clear her expectations that her children be morally clean love as i saw and felt a mothers love in our home kindness as i can genuinely say i never saw her do an unkind thing i thank the lord for loving parents who taught values both spiritual and moral and who wisely made it clear that there were certain nonnegotiablesamong them attendance at church meetings payment of tithing reading of scriptures and respect for parents and church leaders and most significantly they taught by what they did not just by what they said so crucial in strengthening families is the realization that strong family relationships dont just happen it takes time it takes commitment it takes prayer and it takes work parents must realize their responsibility and willingly assume it the joy and happiness that will result is indescribable our beloved prophet president gordon b hinckley has counseled keep nurturing and loving your children among all the assets you possess nothing is so precious as your children quoted in church news 3 feb 1996 2 i leave you my witness that the proclamation on the family which i referred to earlier is modernday revelation provided to us by the lord through his latterday prophets god lives jesus is the christ this is his church led by a living prophet in the name of jesus christ amen
