agency and anger by elder lynn g robbins of the seventy imageelder lynn g robbins a cunning part of satans strategy is to dissociate anger from agency making us believe that we are victims of an emotion that we cannot control i have a family here on earth they are so good to me this is the hope of every child expressed in the words of one of our hymns families can be together forever hymns no 300 emphasis added we learn in the proclamation on the family that the family is central to the creators plan and that husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness the family a proclamation to the world ensign nov 1995 102 the family is also satans primary target he is waging war on the family one of his schemes is the subtle and cunning way he has of sneaking behind enemy lines and entering our very homes and lives he damages and often destroys families within the walls of their own homes his strategy is to stir up anger between family members satan is the father of contention and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger one with another 3 ne 1129 emphasis added the verb stir sounds like a recipe for disaster put tempers on medium heat stir in a few choice words and bring to a boil continue stirring until thick cool off let feelings chill for several days serve cold lots of leftovers a cunning part of his strategy is to dissociate anger from agency making us believe that we are victims of an emotion that we cannot control we hear i lost my temper losing ones temper is an interesting choice of words that has become a widely used idiom to lose something implies not meaning to accidental involuntary not responsiblecareless perhaps but not responsible he made me mad this is another phrase we hear also implying lack of control or agency this is a myth that must be debunked no one makes us mad others dont make us angry there is no force involved becoming angry is a conscious choice a decision therefore we can make the choice not to become angry we choose to those who say but i cant help myself author william wilbanks responds nonsense aggression suppressing the anger talking about it screaming and yelling are all learned strategies in dealing with anger we choose the one that has proved effective for us in the past ever notice how seldom we lose control when frustrated by our boss but how often we do when annoyed by friends or family the new obscenity readers digest dec 1988 24 emphasis added in his sophomore year wilbanks tried out for the high school basketball team and made it on the first day of practice his coach had him play oneonone while the team observed when he missed an easy shot he became angry and stomped and whined the coach walked over to him and said you pull a stunt like that again and youll never play for my team 23 for the next three years he never lost control again years later as he reflected back on this incident he realized that the coach had taught him a lifechanging principle that day anger can be controlled in the joseph smith translation of ephesians 426 paul asks the question can ye be angry and not sin the lord is very clear on this issue he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me but is of the devil who is the father of contention and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger one with another behold this is not my doctrine to stir up the hearts of men with anger one against another but this is my doctrine that such things should be done away 3 ne 112930 this doctrine or command from the lord presupposes agency and is an appeal to the conscious mind to make a decision the lord expects us to make the choice not to become angry nor can becoming angry be justified in matthew 5 verse 22 the lord says but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment emphasis added how interesting that the phrase without a cause is not found in the inspired joseph smith translation see matt 524 nor in the 3 nephi 1222 version when the lord eliminates the phrase without a cause he leaves us without an excuse but this is my doctrine that such things should be done away 3 ne 1130 we can do away with anger for he has so taught and commanded us anger is a yielding to satans influence by surrendering our selfcontrol it is the thoughtsin that leads to hostile feelings or behavior it is the detonator of road rage on the freeway flareups in the sports arena and domestic violence in homes unchecked anger can quickly trigger an explosion of cruel words and other forms of emotional abuse that can scar a tender heart it is that which cometh out of the mouth the savior said this defileth a man matt 1511 david o mckay said let husband and wife never speak in loud tones to each other unless the house is on fire stepping stones to an abundant life comp llewelyn r mckay 1971 294 physical abuse is anger gone berserk and is never justified and always unrighteous anger is an uncivil attempt to make another feel guilty or a cruel way of trying to correct them it is often mislabeled as discipline but is almost always counterproductive therefore the scriptural warning husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them and fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged col 319 21 choice and accountability are inseparable principles because anger is a choice there is a strong warning in the proclamation that individuals who abuse spouse or offspring will one day stand accountable before god understanding the connection between agency and anger is the first step in eliminating it from our lives we can choose not to become angry and we can make that choice today right now i will never become angry again ponder this resolution the 121st section of the doctrine and covenants is one of our best sources to learn correct leadership principles perhaps the most important application of section 121 is to spouses and parents we are to lead our families by persuasion by longsuffering by gentleness kindness and meekness and by love unfeigned see dc 1214142 may each childs dream of having a family here on earth that is good to them come true this is my prayer and my testimony in the name of jesus christ amen
