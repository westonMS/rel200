the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith by president james e faust second counselor in the first presidency imagepresident james e faust we are to focus on the inward things of the heart which we know and value intuitively but often neglect for that which is trivial superficial or prideful my beloved brothers and sisters and friends i have prayed earnestly that you might understand my words this morning in the spirit which is intended i therefore seek your faith and prayers in my behalf jesus of nazareth described his ultimate work this is my work and my gloryto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man1 his work is accomplished through his gospel which carries the impress of the savior himself i humbly wish to speak of the essence of the gospel the savior taught that judgment mercy and faith are the weightier matters of the law2 i wish to state unequivocally that the commandments of god must be kept to receive the blessings and promises of the savior the ten commandments are still a vital thread in the fabric of the gospel of christ but with his coming came new light and life which brings a fuller measure of joy and happiness jesus introduced a higher and more difficult standard of human conduct it is simpler as well as more difficult because it focuses on internal rather than external requirements do unto others as you would have them do unto you3 love your neighbor as yourself4 when smitten turn the other cheek5 when asked for a coat give your cloak also6 forgive not just once but seventy times seven7 this was the essence of the new gospel there was more emphasis on do than do not more moral agency was given to each of us joseph smith the prophet of the dispensation of the fulness of times established the church by revelation as the receptacle of gospel truth he brought more light warmth and joy into the church through the numerous lofty revelations such as how the priesthood should be exercised no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood only by persuasion by longsuffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned8 this high standard of conduct if lived will bring to fruition the promise men are that they might have joy9 over the centuries dogmatism coercion and intolerance have too often polluted the living water of the gospel which quenches our spiritual thirst eternally10 the savior observed this in his day woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel11 similarly paul said the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life12 we are not only to avoid evil not only to do good but most importantly to do the things of greatest worth we are to focus on the inward things of the heart which we know and value intuitively but often neglect for that which is trivial superficial or prideful the saving principles and doctrines of the church are established fixed and unchangeable obedience to these absolutes is necessary to enjoy peace in this world and eternal life in the world to come13 however the manner in which the church administers complex and varied worldwide challenges changes from time to time under guidance from living prophets new guidelines and procedures are put in place i welcome these inspired changes they are proof of the truthfulness of the restored gospel i have some fear however that some members consider guidelines and procedures to be as important as the timeless immutable laws of the gospel such as thou shalt not commit adultery14 rather than some legalistic definition of adultery the saviors more enlightened direction is that the thought is father to the deed he that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart15 who decides what is right and wrong in given circumstances where does the responsibility for the making of moral judgments rest with mature individuals of course it rests with each individual in the case of children the responsibility of giving moral guidance rests with the parents they know the disposition understanding and intelligence of each child parents spend a lifetime seeking to establish and maintain good communications with each of their children they are in the best position to make the ultimate moral decisions as to the welfare and wellbeing of their offspring the higher principles of the gospeljustice mercy and faithare very important in all family relationships many years ago when i was a bishop a conscientious father came to me for counsel he felt that the many and frequent activities of the church made it difficult to have as much family togetherness as he and his wife deemed necessary the children had the idea that they were not loyal to the church if they did not participate fully in every recreational activity i told this caring father that church activities were to help him and his wife rear their children they as parents had not only the right but the duty to determine the extent of their familys involvement in social activities family unity solidarity and harmony should be preserved after all a family is the basic permanent unit of the church there are three sources of guidance for making moral judgments first is the guidance of the holy ghost this is always a sure compass for those who have been baptized and received this supernal gift the second source is the wise counsel of priesthood leaders whom the lord has put in place to guide us third the constant demonstration of love should temper all our judgments sometimes this means discipline the prophet joseph smith was once asked how he governed so diverse a people his answer was i teach the people correct principles and they govern themselves16 this statement is just as true today as it was in josephs time there must be listening ears and obedience to the living prophet of the church president marion g romney stated it well it is an easy thing to believe in the dead prophets but it is a greater thing to believe in the living prophets i will give you an illustration one day when president grant was living i sat in my office across the street following a general conference a man came over to see me an elderly man he was very upset about what had been said in this conference by some of the brethren including myself i could tell from his speech that he came from a foreign land after i had quieted him enough so he would listen i said why did you come to america i came here because a prophet of god told me to come who was the prophet i continued wilford woodruff do you believe wilford woodruff was a prophet of god yes said he do you believe that his successor president lorenzo snow was a prophet of god yes i do do you believe that president joseph f smith was a prophet of god yes sir then came the sixtyfour dollar question do you believe that heber j grant is a prophet of god his answer i think he ought to keep his mouth shut about old age assistance17 today we have a living prophet president gordon b hinckley whom we sustain as the prophet of our day he has warned us to speak up for moral standards in a world where filth sleaze pornography and their whole evil brood are sweeping over us as a flood his counsel to us in our day is stand up for integrity in your business in your profession in your home in the society of which you are a part18 indeed moral standards must be maintained in large measure those who are disobedient punish themselves as the lord said through jeremiah thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backslidings shall reprove thee19 those entrusted with judicial responsibility in the kingdom of god must see that the church remains clean so that the living waters of life flow unimpeded however true religion is not looking primarily for weaknesses faults and errors it is the spirit of strengthening and overlooking faults even as we would wish our own faults to be overlooked when we focus our entire attention on what may be wrong rather than what is right we miss the sublime beauty and essence of the sweet gospel of the master judgment the weightier matter of the law mentioned by the savior cannot be separated from the other two mercy and faith shakespeare wrote of the quality of mercy speaking through portia he said we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy20 i am frank to admit that when i say my prayers i do not ask for justice i ask for mercy one of the great examples of mercy in our time was extended by the prophet joseph to w w phelps during the troubles of the saints in the state of missouri elder phelps fell into apostasy after suffering buffetings on june 29 1840 while in dayton ohio w w phelps wrote to the prophet joseph i have seen the folly of my way and i tremble at the gulf i have passed i will repent and live and ask my old brethren to forgive me and though they chasten me to death yet i will die with them for their god is my god the least place with them is enough for me yea it is bigger and better than all babylon i have done wrong and i am sorry i have not walked along with my friends according to my holy anointing i ask forgiveness in the name of jesus christ of all the saints for i will do right god helping me i want your fellowship if you cannot grant that grant me your peace and friendship for we are brethren and our communion used to be sweet21 to this the prophet joseph replied it is true that we have suffered much in consequence of your behaviorthe cup of gall already full enough was indeed filled to overflowing when you turned against us one with whom we had oft taken sweet counsel together and enjoyed many refreshing seasons from the lordhad it been an enemy we could have borne it however the cup has been drunk the will of our father has been done and we are yet alive and having been delivered from the hands of wicked men by the mercy of our god we say it is your privilege to be delivered from the powers of the adversary and again take your stand among the saints of the most high and by diligence humility and love unfeigned commend yourself to our god and your god and to the church of jesus christ believing your confession to be real and your repentance genuine i shall be happy once again to give you the right hand of fellowship and rejoice over the returning prodigal come on dear brother since the war is past for friends at first are friends again at last yours as ever joseph smith jun22 w w phelps remained true and faithful and wrote the words to the marvelous hymn praise to the man affirming his great love and admiration for the prophet joseph praise to the man who communed with jehovah jesus anointed that prophet and seer blessed to open the last dispensation kings shall extol him and nations revere23 the childlike faith of a follower of the divine christ is a choice spiritual gift it can be enjoyed by young and old in the early days of the church a young boy by the name of will cluff 10 years of age living in nauvoo had a remarkable pure faith he had an experience to which many of us can relate his family was poor and had only one cow which they depended on for food in the spring of 1842 the cow strayed off one evening in august his father came home very weary and discouraged he and wills brothers had spent much of the summer looking for the cow will said father if you will let me take charley an old horse i will go and find the cow he reluctantly said he could early next morning will rode to the big mound three miles east and in the prairie country here he had often herded cows with other boys from nauvoo he got off the horse and holding it by the bridle knelt down and fervently prayed the lord to direct him which way to go to find the cow he climbed back on the horse and rode south a course he was impressed to take even though there were numerous bunches of cattle in every direction after traveling a few miles in the open prairie and passing hundreds of cattle will came to a fence he dismounted and let down the stake led his horse in put up the fence then rode three miles across the field he again found himself in the open prairie with numerous bunches of stock in every direction when he had gone about a quarter of a mile from the field he rode right on to the cow feeding alone some distance from any other animals will started to drive the cow in the direction of the city he arrived late in the evening full of joy and thankful to his father in heaven24 i fear that some of our greatest sins are sins of omission these are some of the weightier matters of the law the savior said we should not leave undone25 these are the thoughtful caring deeds we fail to do and feel so guilty for having neglected them as a small boy on the farm during the searing heat of the summer i remember my grandmother mary finlinson cooking our delicious meals on a hot woodstove when the wood box next to the stove became empty grandmother would silently pick up the box go out to refill it from the pile of cedar wood outside and bring the heavily laden box back into the house i was so insensitive and interested in the conversation in the kitchen i sat there and let my beloved grandmother refill the kitchen wood box i feel ashamed of myself and have regretted my omission for all of my life i hope someday to ask for her forgiveness we are directed into the pathway to the kingdom of god by the saviors own words said he the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you26 and the kingdom of heaven is at hand27 we are shown the way into the kingdom of god on earth in the same way those who extend judgment mercy faith and forgiveness exhibit a greatness of soul and mind consistent with the spirit of the lords teachings and example this higher gospel requires that we look inward to our own souls for we cannot deceive the lord we are told that the keeper of the gate is the holy one of israel and he employeth no servant there28 those of us who hold the holy apostleship always wish to fulfill our responsibility by testifying of the divinity of the savior i feel compelled to do so i have had a testimony all of my life recently however there has come into my soul an overpowering witness of the divinity of this holy work this sure witness is more certain than ever before in my life of this i testify in the name of jesus christ amen notes moses 139 matt 2323 see matt 712 see matt 223739 see luke 629 see matt 540 see matt 182122 dc 12141 2 ne 225 see john 414 matt 232324 2 cor 36 dc 5923 ex
