the plan of salvation a flight plan for life by elder duane b gerrard of the seventy imageelder duane b gerrard what a great and wonderful plan is the plan of salvation which teaches true principles to allow completion of our journey through life the lord has carefully provided a plan of life called the plan of salvation it comprises all of the laws ordinances principles and doctrines required to complete our mortal journey and progress to a state of exaltation enjoyed by our father in heaven the lord spoke to moses and said for behold this is my work and my gloryto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man1 through his divine workthe creation the fall and the atonementhe makes this plan available to all as a recently retired airline pilot ive filed many flight plans in my years of flyingflight plans that led me safely to my destination airlines also have laws procedures principles and regulations we carefully follow these strict procedures and checklists that are grouped into three specific areas first we have normal procedures these we do regularly and consistently every flight to ensure safety next we have abnormal procedures these are used when something out of the ordinary takes place like the loss of a hydraulic or electrical system abnormal procedures must be done precisely and in proper sequence and order to restore all systems to normal finally we have emergency procedures used only in the most dire and critical of circumstances like a flameout rapid depressurization or severe turbulence in these procedures i find close parallels to the plan of salvation first the lord has created a beautiful earth for his children to live on and mortal bodies that are temples for our spirits our bodies are truly a joy and a pleasure in our flight through life the book of mormon tells us men are that they might have joy2 we must not corrupt nor misuse our wonderful bodies they are godgiven sacred and designed by the lorda perfect example of the beauty of his creations we are raised by mortal parents whose kind and loving care teach us correct principles or normal procedures that if followed daily will surely help us continue lifes flight plan we are taught principles such as love honesty kindness patience trust sharing repentance obedience faith baptism prayer and a host of other eternal principles these are taught in a family setting by diligent and loving parents and reinforced by kind brothers sisters and friends these normal procedures come as basic training in the lords plan of salvation the lord tells us to honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee3 show your parents love and respect for they in partnership with the lord are responsible for your mortal bodies and basic training how grateful i am for kind and loving parents who taught me these true principles of life next there are abnormal procedures which i liken to the abnormal happenings in our daily lives like the disappointment of failing a class in school due to laziness or apathy carelessness leading to injury or accident or disobedience leading to serious sinsin that requires complete repentance followed by forgiveness these abnormals sometimes are part of our lives and must be overcome i once asked a retiring chief pilot how he managed to fly nearly 40 years without an accident or even incident he replied good decisions and how do you always make good decisions i asked he replied experience and how do you gain experience i persisted bad decisions was his response but my pilot friend was wrong there is no need to make bad decisions president marion g romney once stated now i tell you that you can make every decision in your life correctly if you can learn to follow the guidance of the holy spirit4 this plus frequent reference to the scriptures allows us to learn much from the experiences of others if however we do make mistakes the lord expects us to learn from our bad decisions and our normal and abnormal procedures require us to confess repent and seek forgiveness and thus by so doing even failure can become success the lords plan has given us those who care and comfort us in times of failure and sin our parents bishops quorum leaders and advisers i am grateful for a plan that provides these wonderful parents leaders and teachers who really care im especially grateful for our savior whose atonement makes repentance and forgiveness possible although our abnormal procedures must occasionally be used if we are humble and wise and use good judgment we will always repent and return all systems to normal in flying they say a superior pilot is one who uses superior judgment to avoid situations that require superior skill and tremendous effort to overcome the repentance process should become a frequent normal procedure to teach us to deal with the infrequent abnormal occurrences of lifeoh the difference between nearly right and exactly right fortunately in my flying career ive rarely needed to use emergency procedures even though i frequently trained and prepared for them emergency procedures provide help and direction in the most dire of circumstances some of these we all must face as we experience the severe turbulence of life such as the loss of a loved one the discovery of a serious disease estrangement or financial disaster emergency procedures are used in times of utmost peril when ones testimony is tested and tried we then must rely on our inner strength a knowledge of the gospel which reminds us of the principles we hold dear and the comfort that comes when we endure all things and rely on the savior and allow his spirit to warm us with his cloak of love we find solace by searching the scriptures pondering messages of prophets and feeling the deep love and devotion of our spouse family and friends with the use of emergency procedures we carefully but surely maintain our flight plan to our eternal destination are you familiar with your flight plan of lifethe lords plan of salvation can you effectively use the normal abnormal and emergency procedures or principles the lord has provided do you study practice train and rehearse these divine principles are you prepared in every respect to follow this great plan of salvation if not then do as we do in the airlinesenroll yourself in a refresher course the lords recurrent training become more actively involved in christs teachings always attend sacrament meeting and keep the sabbath day holy pay tithes and offerings more faithfully be morally clean pray regularly and with more purity of purpose hold family home evening study the scriptures give more of yourself to others show more love to family and friends be an example of goodness compassion and charity the prophet joseph smith told us a man filled with the love of god is not content with blessing his family alone but ranges through the whole world anxious to bless the whole human race5 we should all do likewise what a great and wonderful plan is the plan of salvation which like the many flight plans ive filed teaches true principles to allow completion of our journey through life i know god lives and i testify of jesus christ he is gods only begotten son our savior and redeemer who loves us all im grateful for his marvelous plan of salvation our flight plan of
