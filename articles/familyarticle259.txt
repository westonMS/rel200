the home a refuge and sanctuary by elder eran a call of the seventy imageelder eran a call may the family a proclamation to the world become the guideline and standard by which we live in our homes and raise our children i humbly pray that the spirit of truth might be with us that we might understand one another be edified and rejoice together1 as nephi i too was born of goodly parents therefore i was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father and have been highly favored of the lord in all my days2 my father was a marvelous example of faith integrity and commitment to the gospel my mother died when i was seven but in my tender youth she taught me the truths of the gospel she was a woman of great faith because of her faith and prayers and a miraculous healing i have sight in my left eye today father was out of town i severely burned the pupil of my eye with a hot metal lid lifter from our woodburning stove mother exercised her faith and prayed fervently to heavenly father as she held me lovingly in her arms her prayers were heard and my eye was healed i am very grateful to have been raised in a loving home by goodly parents the home is being threatened and challenged more today than ever before today less than half of the children born in the united states and in many countries in the world will spend their entire childhood in an intact family3 infidelity divorce abortion and abandoned homes are on the increase the father is rapidly losing his traditional role as caregiver breadwinner protector moral educator and head of the family during 1960 to 1990 a 30year period births outside of marriage in the united states increased 500 percent and divorce increased 400 percent4 as church members we are not free from these sinful practices the home and the family are the fundamental unit of society as the homes are and families are so will be the community the city the state and the nation there is no public morality without private virtue i repeat there is no public morality without private virtue as latterday saints we have been given much and much is expected of us we have been taught what is right and true let us therefore be doers of the word not hearers only5 deceiving ourselves as husbands wives and parents how can we avoid the pitfalls and temptations of the troubled world we live in i offer a few timetested and proven ways that we can be doers and not hearers only parents and family members should love honor and respect each other attend church meetings together regularly read the scriptures and pray together daily hold family home evening and have fun together live lives of virtue and integrity so you can sleep at night knowing you have done your best with a conscience void of offense to anyone a virtuous life is built step by step brick by brick beware of small sins that erode integrity communicate talk take time for each other a teenager comes home from a date and seems to be concernedwhat a marvelous opportunity for loving parents to listen and help faithfully pay your tithes and offerings avoid unnecessary debt never make major purchases nor decisions without prayer and mutual agreement as equal partners as husband and wife we have been taught by ancient and modern prophets that the establishment of a home is not only a privilege but marriage and proper training of children is a duty of the highest order6 the prophets of israel taught ye shall teach your children the commandments when thou sittest in thine house7 isaiah taught all thy children shall be taught of the lord and great shall be the peace of thy children8 i give unto you a commandment to teach your children9 lehi did exhort his family with all the love of a tender parent10 president harold b lee said the greatest of the lords work you brethren will ever do as fathers will be within the walls of your own home11 we should always remember president david o mckays warning from this pulpit 33 years ago no other success can compensate for failure in the home the poorest shack in which love prevails over a united family is of greater value to god and future humanity than any other riches in such a home god can work miracles and will work miracles12 the first presidency and quorum of the twelve apostles whom we sustain as prophets seers and revelators two years ago solemnly proclaimed to the world our beliefs concerning marriage parents and the family i challenge each of you to read study and live by this inspired proclamation may it become the guideline and standard by which we live in our homes and raise our children our homes can be and should be a refuge and a sanctuary from the troubled world we live in may they become such by striving daily to keep sacred the holy covenants we have made may we join with john of old who said i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth13 i humbly pray in the name of jesus christ amen notes see dc 5022 1 ne 11 barbara dafoe whitehead dan
