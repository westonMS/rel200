the eye of faith by elder neil l andersen of the quorum of the twelve apostles if we pick and choose what we accept in the proclamation we cloud our eternal view putting too much importance on our experience here and now shortly before his crucifixion jesus was taken before pilate in the judgment hall art thou the king of the jews pilate condescendingly asked jesus responded my kingdom is not of this world i came into the world that i should bear witness of the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice pilate cynically asked what is truth1 in todays world the question what is truth can be painfully complex to the secular mind a google search for what is truth brings more than a million responses we have more available information on our cell phones than in all the books of a brick and mortar library we live with information and opinion overload enticing and alluring voices pursue us at every turn caught in todays confusion it is no wonder that so many consign themselves to the words spoken 2500 years ago by protagoras to the young socrates what is true for you he said is true for you and what is true for me is true for me2 truth through the restored gospel of jesus christ blessed with the restored gospel of jesus christ we humbly declare that there are some things that are completely and absolutely true these eternal truths are the same for every son and daughter of god the scriptures teach truth is knowledge of things as they are and as they were and as they are to come3 truth looks backward and forward expanding the perspective of our small point in time jesus said i am the way the truth and the life4 truth shows us the way to eternal life and it comes only through our savior jesus christ there is no other way jesus christ teaches us how to live and through his atonement and resurrection he offers us forgiveness from our sins and immortality beyond the veil this is absolutely true he teaches us that it does not matter if we are rich or poor prominent or unknown sophisticated or simple rather our mortal quest is to strengthen our faith in the lord jesus christ to choose good over evil and to keep his commandments while we celebrate the innovations of science and medicine the truths of god go far beyond these discoveries in opposition to the truths of eternity there always have been counterfeits to distract gods children from the truth the arguments of the adversary are always the same listen to these voiced 2000 years ago you cannot know of things you do not see whatever a person does is no crime god is not blessing you but every person prospers according to his own genius5 it is not reasonable that such a being as christ would be the son of god6 what you believe is a foolish tradition and a derangement of your mind7 sounds like today doesnt it with the restoration of the gospel god has given us the way to learn and know essential spiritual truths we learn them through the holy scriptures through our personal prayers and our own experiences through the counsel of the living prophets and apostles and through the guidance of the holy ghost who can help us to know the truth of all things8 truth is spiritually discerned we can know the things of god as we seek them spiritually paul said the things of god knoweth no man except he has the spirit of god for they are spiritually discerned9 look at this art by michael murphy from this perspective you would hardly believe that it is an artistic rendition of a human eye however as you look at the dots from a different perspective you see the beauty of the artists creation likewise we see the spiritual truths of god through the perspective of an eye of faith paul said the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned10 the scriptures our prayers our own experiences modern prophets and the gift of the holy ghost bring us the spiritual perspective of truth necessary for our journey here on earth the proclamation through the eye of faith lets look at the proclamation on the family through the eye of faith president gordon b hinckley introduced the family a proclamation to the world with this statement with so much of sophistry that is passed off as truth with so much of deception concerning standards and values with so much of allurement and enticement to take on the slow stain of the world we have felt to warn you11 the proclamation begins all human beingsmale and femaleare created in the image of god each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents and as such each has a divine nature and destiny these are eternal truths you and i are not an accident of nature i love these words in the premortal realm spirit sons and daughters knew and worshipped god as their eternal father and accepted his plan12 we lived before our birth our individual identity is stamped in us forever in ways we dont fully understand our spiritual growth there in the premortal world influences who we are here13 we accepted gods plan we knew that we would experience difficulties pain and sorrow upon the earth14 we also knew that the savior would come and that as we proved ourselves worthy we would rise in the resurrection having glory added upon our heads for ever and ever15 the proclamation is direct we declare the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed we affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in gods eternal plan our fathers plan encourages a husband and wife to bring children into the world and obligates us to speak in defense of the unborn principles of the proclamation are beautifully connected if we pick and choose what we accept in the proclamation we cloud our eternal view putting too much importance on our experience here and now by prayerfully pondering the proclamation through the eye of faith we better understand how the principles are beautifully connected supporting one another revealing our fathers plan for his children16 should we really be surprised when the lords prophets declare his will and for some questions remain of course some reject the voice of the prophets immediately17 but others prayerfully ponder their honest questionsquestions that will be settled with patience and an eye of faith if the proclamation had been revealed in a different century there would still have been questions just different questions than those of today one purpose of prophets is to help us in resolving sincere questions18 prior to being the president of the church president russell m nelson said prophets see ahead they see the harrowing dangers the adversary has placed or will yet place in our path prophets also foresee the grand possibilities and privileges awaiting those who listen with the intent to obey19 i testify to the truth and spiritual power of the united voice of the first presidency and the quorum of the twelve the world walking away in my lifetime we have seen a dramatic change in the worlds beliefs about many of the principles taught in the proclamation during my teenage and early married years many in the world walked away from the lords standard we call the law of chastity that sexual relations are to occur only between a man and a woman who are lawfully married in my 20s and 30s many walked away from the sacred protection of the unborn as abortion became more acceptable in more recent years many have walked away from gods law that marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman20 watching many walking away from the boundaries the lord has set reminds us of that day in capernaum when the savior declared his divinity and sadly many of his disciples walked away the savior then turned to the twelve will ye also go away peter answered lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god21 not all fit neatly inside the proclamation there are so many young and old who are loyal and true to the gospel of jesus christ even though their own current experience does not fit neatly inside the family proclamation children whose lives have been shaken by divorce youth whose friends mock the law of chastity divorced women and men who have been gravely wounded by the unfaithfulness of a spouse husbands and wives who are unable to have children women and men who are married to a spouse who does not share their faith in the restored gospel single women and men who for various reasons have been unable to marry one friend of nearly 20 years whom i admire greatly is not married because of samesex attraction he has remained true to his temple covenants has expanded his creative and professional talents and has served nobly in both the church and the community he recently said to me i can sympathize with those in my situation who choose not to keep the law of chastity in the world in which we live but didnt christ ask us to be not of this world it is clear that gods standards are different from those of the world the laws of man often move outside the boundaries set by the laws of god for those desiring to please god faith patience and diligence are surely needed22 my wife kathy and i have known a single sister now in her mid40s who is gifted in her professional abilities and serves valiantly in her ward she too has kept the laws of god she wrote i dreamed of the day i would be blessed with a husband and children i am still waiting at times my situation brings feelings of being forgotten and alone but i try to keep the focus off what i dont have and instead on what i do have and how i can help others service to my extended family in my ward and in the temple has helped me i am not forgotten or alone because i am part of and we are all part of a larger family there is one who understands some will say you dont understand my situation i may not but i testify that there is one who does understand23 there is one who knows your burdens because of his sacrifice made in the garden and on the cross as you seek him and keep his commandments i promise you that he will bless you and lift the burdens too heavy to bear alone he will give you eternal friends and opportunities to serve more important he will fill you with the powerful spirit of the holy ghost and shine his heavenly approval upon you no choice no alternative that denies the companionship of the holy ghost or the blessings of eternity is worthy of our consideration i know the savior lives i witness that he is the source of all truth that really matters and that he will fulfill all the blessings he has promised to those who keep his commandments in the name of jesus christ

president russell m nelson recently explained some of the history of the proclamation as summarized by sheri dew in insights from a prophets life russell m nelson 2019 208 one day in 1994 the quorum of the twelve apostles spent a day in their council room in the salt lake temple discussing issues surrounding the family they considered everything from the increasingly ubiquitous nature of pornography to potential antifamily legislation of various kinds this was not a new discussion but that day the entire agenda revolved around this one vital topic the twelve reviewed both doctrine and policies considering those things that could not be changeddoctrineand those things that possibly could bepolicies they discussed issues they saw coming including an intensified societal push for gay marriage and transgender rights but that was not the end of what we saw elder nelson explained we could see the efforts of various communities to do away with all standards and limitations on sexual activity we saw the confusion of genders we could see it all coming this extended discussion along with others over a period of time led to the conclusion that the twelve should prepare a document perhaps even a proclamation outlining the churchs stand on the family to present to the first presidency for consideration the family a proclamation to the world ensign or liahona may 2017 145 president dallin h oaks said all of the myriads of mortals who have been born on this earth chose the fathers plan and fought for it many of us also made covenants with the father concerning what we

ensign or liahona nov 2018 2528 abraham 326 president dallin h oaks has said converted latterday saints believe that the family proclamation issued nearly a quarter century ago and now translated into scores of languages is the lords reemphasis of the gospel truths we need to sustain us through current challenges to the family i testify that the proclamation on the family is a statement of eternal truth the will of the lord for his children who seek eternal life it has been the basis of church teaching and practice for the last 22 years and will continue so for the future consider it as such teach it live by it and you will be blessed as you press forward toward eternal life i believe our attitude toward and use of the family proclamation is one of those tests for this generation i pray for all latterday saints to stand firm in that test the plan and the proclamation ensign or liahona nov 2017 3031 president russell m nelson has said there are those who label us as bigots but the bigots are those who dont allow us to feel as we feel but want us to allow them to feel as they feel our stand ultimately boils down to the law of chastity the ten commandments are still valid theyve never been revoked it is not our prerogative to change laws that god has decreed in dew insights from a prophets life 212 while the family is under attack across the entire world the truths of the family proclamation will fortify you you wonderful youth of the noble birthright you need to understand the farreaching consequences of societys current skirmish over the very definition of marriage the present debate involves the question of whether two people of the same gender can be married if you have a question about the position of the church on this or any other important issue prayerfully ponder it and then heed the prophetic messages at this forthcoming october general conference of the church those inspired addresses plus inspiration from the holy ghost will bring to your

and secular philosophies as they write rewrite and enforce laws regardless of what civil legislation may be enacted the doctrine of the lord regarding marriage and morality cannot be changed remember

as well he will take upon him death that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people and he will take upon him their infirmities that his bowels may be filled with mercy according to the
