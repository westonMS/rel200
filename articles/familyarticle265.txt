caring for the souls of children by patricia p pinegar primary general president imagepatricia p pinegar tell your children that you love them and that you are so happy to have them in your family prepare yourselves spiritually to receive the guidance through the holy ghost the longer i serve in my calling as primary president the greater is my concern for children children are a sacred gift from a loving heavenly father children are an heritage of the lord ps 1273 the more i think about children the more i worry about parents president spencer w kimball said our heavenly father placed the responsibility upon parents to see that their children are well fed well groomed and clothed well trained and well taught most parents protect their children with shelterthey tend and care for their diseases provide clothes for their safety and their comfort and supply food for their health and growth but what do they do for their souls the teachings of spencer w kimball ed edward l kimball 1982 332 i am afraid that some children may someday have the feelings expressed by the psalmist i looked on my right hand and beheld but there was no man that would know me refuge failed me no man cared for my soul ps 1424 today i speak to all parents and every adult member of the church and invite all to unite in caring for the souls of children several years ago i was working in my garden and was delighted to see a family of quail i watched the father sitting on top of the wall standing guard the mother was busy keeping her 10 precious babies together and seemed to be demonstrating how to peck in the earth for food i was fascinated i carefully and quietly walked closer all too soon i was detected by the watchful father and he let out a warning call the mother tried to guide the children around the wall to safety but ithe dangerwas too near and she became frustrated and confused and flew up on the wall by the father i didnt want to harm this family so i quickly retreated out of sight unlike my experience with the quail family the dangers threatening the lives of our families do not retreat satan rejoices in our confusion and frustration and his influences surround us we turn on the televisionis this a family show we hear something coming out of our childs roomis this music we try to pick a moviedid this one really have an acceptable rating sometimes satans influences are more subtle i have asked myself these questions do i leave my children exposed to danger when i dont teach them the truths of the gospel do i neglect their souls when i dont help them recognize the promptings of the spirit and the guidance they can receive do i leave my children exposed to danger when my example is not the same as my words or when i dont share my love in such a way that each child feels it deeply statistics and news reports tell us that there are children who have been tragically deserted happily that is not the plight of all children i have visited homes where love abounds the gospel is taught and childrens souls are well cared for i have witnessed single parents who are magnificent in their faith and dedication i know single adults who are involving themselves in the lives of families and strengthening both the parents and the children i know teachers and leaders and other caring adults who touch the lives of children and youth who care for their souls the blessings of parenting and helping to care for children are many president hinckley said of all the joys of life none other equals that of happy parenthood of all the responsibilities with which we struggle none other is so serious to rear children in an atmosphere of love security and faith is the most rewarding of all challenges the good result from such efforts becomes lifes most satisfying
