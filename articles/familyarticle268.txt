this thing was not done in a corner by president gordon b hinckley president of the church imagepresident gordon b hinckley my dear brethren we have received good counsel this evening since we met last april i have been much out among our people i have determined that for so long as i have the strength to do so i will get out and meet with the saints i love both the youth and the adults i have in recent months participated in many meetings with more than 300000 latterday saints in 17 different nations we have traveled from sea to sea across the united states and extensively in asia and in europe i do not enjoy travel i weary of it jet lag for me is a very real thing but i do enjoy looking into the faces and shaking the hands of faithful latterday saints and i thank those who have made this possible as i have gone about the world i have had opportunity for interviews with representatives of the media this is always a worrisome undertaking because one never knows what will be asked these reporters are men and women of great capacity who know how to ask questions that come at you like a javelin it is not exactly an enjoyable experience but it represents an opportunity to tell the world something of our story as paul said to festus and agrippa this thing was not done in a corner acts 2626 we have something that this world needs to hear about and these interviews afford an opportunity to give voice to that one of the most extensive interviews was with mr mike wallace of the cbs 60 minutes program i express appreciation to senator orrin hatch willard marriott jr and steve young who participated in this program millions saw the outcome this last easter sunday as elder haight said this morning the editors of the program distilled about 15 minutes out of many hours of filming i developed a deep respect for mr wallace he is a very able professional he was courteous respectful incisive in his questions one who might be described as a tough streetwise reporter with long experience but a gentleman in the best sense of the word i first met him at a luncheon at the harvard club in new york about a year ago he then came to salt lake city on two different occasions and interviewed me at great length in my office i have thought this evening to read parts of those interviews as they were recordedhis questions and my extemporaneous answers just as they were given and without editing except to delete areas in the interest of time and add in brackets an occasional needed word i do so in the spirit of reaffirming the position of this church on a number of different and significant matters of general concern for the most part this is from the material not used in the broadcast here are mr wallaces questions and my extemporaneous unrehearsed answers mr wallace are you concerned about misconceptions about the mormon church my answer there are still many ideas that persist concerning us we are not well known we have grown up in the west for the most part the church originated in palmyra new york you have heard of the mormon migration to the west where we established some three or four hundred different communities we would like to let people come to know us for what we are and what we are trying to accomplish question are there any conflicts between your convictions about families and womens roles with the family and the aspirations of some women to occupy leadership positions in your church reply we have a few women who feel that women should hold the priesthood we have a great womens organization i believe it is the largest womens organization in the worldour womens relief society they have their own officers who preside over their own organization they carry forward a tremendous program of education among women i think they are happy they are doing a great work mr wallace since world war ii we seem to be splintering we seem to be becoming more selfish more selfabsorbed less community minded families dont seem to mean so much and morality has gone to hell his expression in a handbasket why response the basic failure is in our homes parents havent measured up to their responsibilities it is evident a nation will rise no higher than the strength of its homes if you want to reform a nation you begin with families with parents who teach their children principles and values that are positive and affirmative and will lead them to worthwhile endeavors that is the basic failure that has taken place in america and we are making a tremendous effort to bring about greater solidarity in families parents have no greater responsibility in this world than the bringing up of their children in the right way and they will have no greater satisfaction as the years pass than to see those children grow in integrity and honesty and make something of their lives his question your church has a very strict code of health why is that a part of religion reply the body is the temple of the spirit the body is sacred it was created in the image of god it is something to be cared for and used for good purposes it ought to be taken care of and this thing which we call the word of wisdom which is a code of health is most helpful in doing that his question for some particularly those who are not mormons your teachings demand conformity rigidity those are the complaints one hears response oh yes you may hear those complaints i dont think it is so i dont think there is substance to it our people have tremendous liberty they are free to live their lives as they please he asked are they answer oh absolutely surely they have to make choices it is the old eternal battle that has been going on since the war in heaven spoken of in the book of revelation the forces of evil against the forces of good we all exercise agency in the choices we make mr wallace you also have a moral code reply we believe in chastity before marriage and total fidelity after marriage that sums it up that is the way to happiness in living that is the way to satisfaction it brings peace to the heart and peace to the home next question some of the students weve talked to say that the health code is easy compared to no premarital sex they say that not smoking or not drinking is a clear line but that the sexual line is somewhere well they are confused some of them anyway about where that line is response oh i think they know any young man or woman who has grown up in this church knows where that line is when you see yourself slipping begin to exercise some selfdiscipline and if it is a serious problem take it to the lord talk with god about it share your burden with him he will give you strength he will help you they know that i am confident they know that mr wallace why must only men run the church reply only men do not run the church men have their place in the church men hold the priesthood offices of the church but women have a tremendous place in this church they have their own organization it was started in 1842 by the prophet joseph smith called the relief society because its initial purpose was to administer help to those in need it has grown to be i think the largest womens organization in the world with a membership of more than three million they have their own offices their own presidency their own board that reaches down to the smallest unit of the church everywhere in the world his next question but they dont have the power response they have office they have responsibility they have control of their organization mr wallace but you run it the men run it look im not being answer the men hold the priesthood yes but my wife is my companion in this church the man neither walks ahead of his wife nor behind his wife but at her side they are coequals in this life in a great enterprise mr wallace why is it that mormons apparently have so many children reply we dont dictate family size that is left to the father and the mother the husband and wife and we expect them to make of this the most serious business of their lives the rearing of the family next question there are those who say that mormonism began as a cult you dont like to hear that response i dont know what that means really but if it has negative connotations i dont accept it as applying to this church people may have applied it they may have applied it in the early days but look here is this great church now there are only six churches in america with more members than this church we are the second church in membership in the state of california we are reaching out across the world we are in more than 150 nations this is a great strong viable organization with a tremendous outreach you will find our people in business institutions high in educational circles in politics in government in whatever we are rather ordinary people trying to do an extraordinary work mr wallace its expensive to be a mormon answer oh it isnt expensive we are living by the law of the lordtithing question but 10 percent of your gross goes to the church and you have nothing to do with the way the money is spentan average mormon that is reply the average mormon has a good deal to do with it he is a member of the church mr wallace but he has nothing to do with how it is going to be spent response if he is a bishop he has the expenditures of his ward a lot of that money comes back to the local units what is that money used for it is used for church purposes his question what are church purposes exactly answer building chapels about 375 a year think about that new buildings each year to accommodate the needs of the growing membership it is used for education we maintain the largest private churchsponsored university in the world brigham young university with its 27000 students on that campus as well as other campuses we maintain a tremendous institute of religion program where we have offcampus connections with students in the major universities of america you will find institutes at ucla usc harvard yale princeton the university of new york the university of massachusetts the massachusetts institute of technology and so forth when it comes to the financial circumstances of the church we have all funds carefully audited we have a corps of auditors who are qualified cpas who are independent from all other agencies of the church and who report only to the first presidency of the church we try to be very careful i keep on the credenza behind my desk a widows mite that was given me in jerusalem many years ago as a reminder a constant reminder of the sanctity of the funds with which we have to deal they come from the widow they are her offering as well as the tithe of the rich man and they are to be used with care and discretion for the purposes of the lord we treat them carefully and safeguard them and try in every way that we can to see that they are used as we feel the lord would have them used for the upbuilding of his work and the betterment of people mr wallace young men and women give two years of their lives to serve as missionaries response young women serve 18 months the work is strenuous it is difficult it isnt easy to go to new york or london or tokyo and knock on doors and face people you have never met before but it does something for you it does two or three things it creates in the first place a feeling of reliance upon the lord it builds within a young man something of strength and capacity if he goes to a foreign land he develops expertise in the language he learns to speak the language of the people wherever he goes he comes to know the people among whom he serves and brings back with him something of their culture their way of doing things with appreciation and respect for them and their conditions and circumstances there is nothing like itwhen you think that we have nearly 50000 out right now and that number is constantly rotating so that it touches the lives of hundreds of thousands of these people i can walk down the streets of salt lake city with you and meet people who speak fluently in japanese and chinese and swedish and norwegian and finnish and spanish and portuguese and who have love in their hearts for the people among whom they served question why are members of the church expected to keep a years supply of food clothing and fuel reply we teach selfreliance as a principle of life that we ought to provide for ourselves and take care of our own needs and so we encourage our people to have something to plan ahead keep food on hand to establish a savings account if possible against a rainy day catastrophes come to people sometimes when least expectedunemployment sickness things of that kind the individual as we teach ought to do for himself all that he can when he has exhausted his resources he ought to turn to his family to assist him when the family cant do it the church takes over and when the church takes over our great desire is to first take care of his immediate needs and then to help him for so long as he needs to be helped but in that process to assist him in training in securing employment in finding some way of getting on his feet again thats the whole objective of this great welfare program mr wallace why is salt lake city so clean answer well we hope it is a reflection of the people who live here mr wallace it is astonishing to walk down the streets of salt lake city hed just come from new york city response we hope it will stay that way i hope that it reflects in some measure at least some of the teachings of this church look at the beauties of temple square right here in the heart of the city the very core of the city look at the magnificent temple and that great tabernacle they were built with vision by people with culture with refinement with artistry these are not the work of charlatans they are the work of people who had a great vision to do beautiful things mr wallace the mormons mr president call you a living moses a prophet who literally communicates with jesus how do you do that reply let me say first that there is a tremendous history behind this church a history of prophecy a history of revelation and decisions which set the pattern of the church so that there are not constant recurring problems that require any special dispensation but there are occasionally things that arise where the will of the lord is needed and is sought and in those circumstances i think the best way i could describe the process is to liken it to the experience of elijah as set forth in the book of first kings elijah spoke to the lord and there was a wind a great wind and the lord was not in the wind and there was an earthquake and the lord was not in the earthquake and there was a fire and the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice which i describe as the whisperings of the spirit now let me just say categorically that the things of god are understood by the spirit of god and one must have and seek and cultivate that spirit and there comes understanding and it is real i can give testimony of that question why is your church so aggressive about spreading the word having missionaries knock on doors where they may not be welcome and where theyre obviously not invited answer we believe that the lord meant what he said when he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature mark 1615 we believe in that mandate we think it rests upon us to try to fulfill it we are doing that with all of the energy and resources that we have mr wallace how do you view nonmormons response with love and respect i have many nonmormon friends i respect them i have the greatest of admiration for them question despite the fact that they havent really seen the light yet reply yes to anybody who is not of this church i say we recognize all of the virtues and the good that you have bring it with you and see if we might add to it mr wallace tell me about brigham young reply brigham young had a prophetic vision can anyone doubt it who looks around here today no and thats the way it is with this church it has been led by revelation we believe all that god has revealed all that he does now reveal and that he will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the kingdom of god for the blessing of his sons and daughters wherever they may be found question as you know some skeptics say that major changes in church policy have come from political pressures not necessarily as revelations from god for example the business of ending polygamy say the skeptics wasnt because it was revelation but because utah wanted to become a state response one of the purposes of a prophet is to seek the wisdom and the will of the lord and to teach his people accordingly it was the case with moses when he led the children of israel out of egypt it was the case for the old testament prophets when people were faced with oppression and trouble and difficulty that is the purpose of a prophet to give answers to people for the dilemmas in which they find themselves that is what happens that is what we see happen is it a matter of expediency political expediency no inspired guidance yes mr wallace how big a problem mr president is child abuse in the mormon church reply i hope it isnt a big problem this is a serious phenomenon that is finding expression all over the world it is a terrible thing it is a wicked thing it is a reprehensible thing it is a thing of which i have spoken time and again question what are you doing to reduce it response we are doing everything we know how to reduce it we are teaching our people we are talking about it we have set up a course of instruction for our bishops all across the nation all last year we carried on an educational program we have set up a helpline for them where they can get professional counseling and help with these problems we have issued a journal dealing with child abuse spouse abuse abuse of the elderly the whole problem of abuse we are concerned about it i am deeply concerned about the victims my heart reaches out to them i want to do everything we can to ease the pain to preclude the happening of this evil and wicked thing i know of no other organization in this world that has taken more exhaustive measures tried harder done more to tackle this problem to work with it to do something to make a change we recognize the terrible nature of it and we want to help our people reach out to them assist them mr wallace one sociologist tells us that the root of the problem is the fact that men in effect in your church have authority over women so that your clergymen tend to sympathize with the men being abusers instead of with the abused response that is one persons opinion i dont think there is any substance to it i think that the men of this church the bishops of this church the officers of this church are as concerned with the welfare of the women of the church as they are with the men of the church and with the children of the church i wouldnt hesitate to say that for one minute i am confident of that i have been around a long time i have known this church from the ground up inside and out over a very very long period of time i am 85 years of age now and ive lived with it all my life and i think i know how it functions i think i know the attitude of our people now there will be a blip here a blip there a mistake here a mistake there but by and large the work is wonderful and vast good is being accomplished and the welfare of women and children is as seriously considered as is the welfare of the men in this church if not more so well brethren thats enough for this occasion needless to say we were blessed of the lord now in conclusion i wish to say that none of us ever need hesitate to speak up for this church for its doctrine for its people for its divine organization and divinely given responsibility it is true it is the work of god the only things that can ever embarrass this work are acts of disobedience to its doctrine and standards by those of its membership that places upon each of us a tremendous responsibility this work will be judged by what the world sees of our behavior god give us the will to walk with faith the discipline to do what is right at all times and in all circumstances the resolution to make of our lives a declaration of this cause before all who see us i humbly pray in the name of jesus christ amen
