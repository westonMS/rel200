thou shalt have no other gods by elder russell m nelson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder russell m nelson as i face this congregation i sense the responsibility entrusted to me as you face the general authorities and officers of the church you also bear responsibility we are all accountable for acting upon the truths that are taught facing you i am reminded of military days long ago when our platoon heard shouts from a sergeant attention right face left face about face we learned to respond to those orders with instant precision in retrospect i dont recall ever having heard his command to face upward yet scriptures tell us to look to god and live1 my topic today relates to the first of the lords ten commandments thou shalt have no other gods before me2 this commandment may be better known than obeyed may i share a suggestion that i have found useful in testing my own allegiance to this commandment when confronted with a challenging choice i ask myself which way do you face life without looking to god sadly many individuals dont know where to find god and exclude him from their lives when spiritual needs arise they may look to the left the right or round about but looking to other people on the same level cannot satisfy spiritual shortages when the immortal spirit is starved hunger persists for something more filling even when material success comes there is a hollow acheif living well falls short of living worthily inner peace cannot be found in affluence accompanied by spiritual privation invitation to come to the lord members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints invite all to come unto christ and enjoy the spiritual feast that his gospel provides the saints savor a sweet spiritual nourishment that sustains them through life this sustenance comes because they have made covenants to take upon themselves the name of the lord and strive to obey his precepts strength comes in recognizing and in being grateful for the lords gifts of immortality and the opportunity for eternal life loyal citizens these gifts are available to all citizens of many countries claim membership in the church regardless of their flag or form of government they find that allegiance to the lord does not preclude their being loyal citizens of their nations fidelity to god enables one to develop a more profound patriotic allegiance and become a better citizen in addition to their national citizenship members of the church are also citizens of gods kingdom3 their commitment to it however may be variable the great majority seek first to build up the kingdom of god and to establish his righteousness4 some allow their allegiance to god and his kingdom to slip below that of other interests in life they have not yet determined which way they face5 representatives of the lord i perceived such confusion in the mind of a newspaper reporter who asked one of our leaders when a representative of suchandsuch a country would become a general authority while that question was being answered i thought about our beloved general authorities born in the countries of asia of europe of north central and south america and of the islands of the sea though these brethren come from many nations and speak several tongues not one of them was called to represent his native country presiding quorums of the church are not representative assemblies each leader has been called to face the people as a representative of the lord not the other way around general authorities are called of god by prophecy and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority6 they are called as especial witnesses7 unto all the world to teach and testify of the lord jesus christ8 obeying commandments of the lord no matter where we live or in what position we serve all of us need to determine which way we face gods commandments serve as a standard against which priorities can be measured our respect for the first commandment fashions our feelings for all the others consider the commandment to keep the sabbath day holy for example9 we live in a time when many people throughout the world have transferred their allegiance on the sabbath from places of worship to places of amusement again i ask which way do you face10 scriptures give us encouragement to do right if thou turn away from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy of the lord and shalt honour him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord11 selfesteem is also earned by obedience to gods commandments regarding chastity12 yet in our day those commands have been attacked and trivialized the morality of selfdiscipline with appropriate denial or restraint has been popularly depicted as unhealthy and dehumanizing the truth is it is dehumanizing to define ourselves by our desires alone13 each human being is a child of godcreated in his imagewith natural appetites to control if we break gods first commandment we cannot escape retribution if we allow any other person or cause to come before allegiance to him we will reap a bitter harvest paul foresaw destruction for those whose god is their belly14 i might include all forms of anatomical affection any who choose to serve the creature more than the creator15 deprive themselves of spiritual reward thus our priorities should be honestly evaluated in terms of that first commandment if change in direction is needed we may want to issue a selfcommand to about face doing so would please the lord who said repent and turn yourselves from your idols and turn away your faces from all your abominations16 trees reach up for the light and grow in the process so do we as sons and daughters of heavenly parents facing upward provides a loftier perspective than facing right or facing left looking up in search of holiness builds strength and dignity as disciples of deity17 facing our families facing upward is crucial for successful parenting families deserve guidance from heaven parents cannot counsel children adequately from personal experience fear or sympathy18 but when parents face children as would the creator who gave them life parents will be endowed with wisdom beyond that of their own wise mothers and fathers will teach members of their family how to make personal decisions based upon divine law19 they will teach them that this life is the time to prepare to meet god20 they will teach them that decisions of a moral and spiritual character cannot be based on freedom to choose without accountability to god for those choices21 with that understanding parents and children will be rewarded with strength of character peace of mind joy and rejoicing in their posterity22 facing our neighbors similarly relationships with neighbors friends and associates will be enhanced as we approach them with the pure love of christ23 a desire to emulate the lord provides powerful motivation for good our craving for compassion will cause us to act in accord with the golden rule24 by so doing we will find joy in feeding the poor clothing the naked or doing volunteer work of worth service to neighbors takes on new stature when we first look to god in the church when priesthood and auxiliary leaders face their congregations quorums and classes as would the lord they learn that it does not matter where they serve but how position in the church does not exalt anyone but faithfulness does on the other hand aspiring to a visible positionstriving to become a master rather than a servantcan destroy the spirit of the worker and the work occasionally confusion exists regarding servants and masters the bible reports that a group of men had disputed among themselves who should be the greatest among them jesus said if any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servant of all25 was jesus asking his disciples to respond to random requests from the crowd or to serve tables26 no he was asking them to serve in his way the people were not to be masters of his disciples the lord is their master in rendering service to others which way do we face from the right or the left we can only push or pull we can lift only from a higher plane to reach it we dont look sideways we look up to our master just as we must look to god to live well so we must look to god to serve well attitudes of effective disciples if we are called to positions of leadership we are accountable to the savior for the acts we perform in that office those actions are shaped by attitudes and attitudes are elevated while lowering our heads in humble prayer so state words in the hymn before thee lord i bow my head look up my soul be not cast down keep not thine eyes upon the ground break off the shackles of the earth receive my soul the spirits birth and now as i go forth again to mingle with my fellowmen stay thou nearby my steps to guide that i may in thy love abide27 praying helps us to face trials in life prayer centers our attitudes precisely with that focus we do not wander to the right or left through land mined with traps of temptation disciples do not flirt with danger at the jagged edge of disaster experienced mountain climbers do not lean toward the dangerous edge but toward safety with ropes and other safeguards to secure them to those they trust so it is with us when we climb mountainous challenges of life we should lean toward our master and be yoked with him clinging tightly to the iron rod of the gospel to family and to trusted friends president david o mckay taught this about edges many of us through selfishness are lingering near the edge of the animal jungle where natures law demands us to do everything with self in view28 the lord said look unto me in every thought doubt not fear not29 i have learned that such faith gives emancipating power facing god first lets us decide firmly what we shall not do then we are free to pursue what we ought to do recently president gordon b hinckley declared love of god is the root of all virtue of all goodness of all strength of character of all fidelity to do right love the lord your god and love his son and be ever grateful for their love for us whenever other love fades there will be that shining transcendent everlasting love of god for each of us and the love of his son who gave his life for us30 brothers and sisters race nationality occupation or other interests need not stand in the way all can look to the lord all can place him first in their lives those who do so and remain faithful will qualify for his sublime promise31 every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me and calleth on my name and obeyeth my voice and keepeth my commandments shall see my face and know that i am32 this glorious

philip 319 rom 125 ezek 146 the importance of looking up to the lord is also emphasized in a vision to the prophet joseph smith dated 21 january 1836 i saw the twelve apostles of the lamb who are now upon the earth who hold the keys of this last ministry in foreign lands standing together in a circle much fatigued with their clothes tattered and feet swollen with their eyes cast downward and jesus standing in their midst and they did not behold him the savior looked upon them and wept teachings of the prophet joseph smith sel joseph fielding smith 1976 107 that the twelve were subsequently vindicated is apparent as we read further in the prophets record and i finally saw the twelve in the celestial kingdom of god i also beheld the redemption of zion and many things which the tongue of men cannot describe in full teachings 108 see prov 35 see dc 1302021 which teaches that any blessing from god is obtained by obedience to that law upon which the blessing is predicated see alma 3432 see dc 10178 jst gen 922 adds this insight when thy posterity shall embrace the truth and look upward then shall zion look downward and all the heavens shall shake with gladness and the earth shall

greatest among you shall be your servant matt 2311 in these scriptures the word servant comes from the greek noun diakonos which means one who executes the commands of another especially of a master diakonos is the greek word from which the english word deacon is derived see acts 62 hymns no 158 improvement era june 1957 390 president james e faust issued this solemn warning living on the edge
