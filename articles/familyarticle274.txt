remember how thou hast received and heard by susan l warner second counselor in the primary general presidency imagesusan l warner my dear brothers and sisters i remember as a little girl driving across the nevada desert with my family to attend general conference in this tabernacle automobiles did not have airconditioning so we traveled at night with a canvas water bag tied to the front of the car in case the radiator boiled over i remember standing outside this building singing the hymns of zion in the darkness of the morning waiting for the large wooden doors to open i remember secretly hoping that i wouldnt be seated behind one of the wide round pillars or worse a lady wearing a large hat though i was scarcely tall enough to see i remember the feelings that came over me as everyone rose when the prophet entered those feelings of excited reverence are spiritual feelings that return each time i enter this building or hear our leaders speak in general conference i remember what i have received and heard i remember what i know and what i have felt each of us has memories of spiritual feelings some of us remember spiritual feelings from our earliest childhood some of us may have memories of feelings when we first discovered the lords true church almost all have spiritual feelings connected with the love of mother father brothers and sisters we may remember feelings of love and belonging that have come while serving in the kingdom with our fellow saints we may remember feeling spiritually renewed on a sabbath evening after attending church studying the gospel together and sharing testimonies we may remember earnest feelings that have accompanied fervent prayer the comfort of the holy ghost in times of trial or sadness we may remember the sorrow and the joy of deep repentanceof feeling forgiven and cleansed we may remember profound feelings of gratitude for the saviors atoning gift of love to us remembering our spiritual feelings draws us to our heavenly father and to his son jesus christ it gives us a sense of our true identity it reminds us of what the prophets have recently proclaimed to the entire world that each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents and as such each has a divine nature and destiny the family a proclamation to the world ensign nov 1995 102 recalling spiritual feelings reminds us of who we really are it is no wonder that over and over in the scriptures we are instructed counseled and commanded o remember remember this repeated invitation emphasizes the important connection between our recollection of spiritual feelings in our past and our faithfulness in the present through john the apostle the lord gave this message remember therefore how thou hast received and heard rev 33 satan wants us to be slow to remember what we have received and heard he wants us to minimize and even forget the quiet witnesses of the spirit that have told us who we really are part of satans evil design is to give our children mistaken ideas of who they arelies for them to remember an elementary school principal reported to me that even our young schoolchildren see and hear the defilement of sacred things in television programs videos and popular music they are exposed to evil things that desensitize them making sin seem normal and acceptable like all of us our children are subtly and constantly encouraged to believe that life has no sacred purpose and that living selfishly is natural and commendable under such influences children may grow up without understanding that they have a father in heaven who loves them that their bodies are sacred temples and that obedience brings good and happy feelings we can help counteract these influences in our families when we follow the counsel of our prophets and in a spirit of love study the scriptures together pray and hold regular family home evenings where we share experiences and bear testimony to one another to help us teach our children and youth our leaders have provided for the strength of youth pamphlet 1990 and my gospel standards which is found on the back of the booklet my achievement days 1995 when we talk about these things in our families share our feelings and learn together at home we build in each family member young and old a rich reserve of doctrinal knowledge and spiritual feelings which will come to their remembrance again and again enos in the book of mormon records his remembrance i went to hunt beasts in the forests and the words which i had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life and the joy of the saints sunk deep into my heart enos 13 enos had been given a reserve of doctrine and feelings to draw upon he gratefully said of his father he taught me in the nurture and admonition of the lordand blessed be the name of my god for it enos 11 one widely recognized expert in helping troubled youth said that the young people who most readily and completely come back after losing their way are those who have a foundation of standards and spirituality to which they can return they are strengthened by their spiritual memories and for them repentance feels like coming home children come into this world pure and open and eager to learn it is our happy privilege and solemn responsibility to lovingly teach them plain and simple gospel truths provide opportunities for them to feel the spirit and help them identify and recognize their own spiritual feelings heavenly father said to father adam therefore i give unto you a commandment to teach these things freely unto your children moses 658 in our family we have tried to hold earlymorning scripture study but we were often frustrated when one son complained and had to be coaxed out of bed when he finally came he would often put his head right down on the table years later while serving his mission he wrote home in a letter thank you for teaching me the scriptures i want you to know that all those times i acted like i was sleeping i was really listening with my eyes closed parents and teachers our efforts to help our children establish a heritage of rich spiritual memories are never wasted sometimes the seeds we plant may not bear fruit for years but we may take comfort in the hope that someday the children we teach will remember how they have received and heard the things of the spirit they will remember what they know and what they have felt they will remember their identity as children of heavenly father who sent them here with a divine purpose each week all over the world members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints come together and remember who they are i am a child of god sing primary children in many languages young women everywhere repeat we are daughters of our heavenly father who loves us young men remember when they serve and perform their duties as worthy aaronic priesthood bearers and when we partake of the sacrament all of us remember as we witness our willingness to take upon ourselves the name of jesus christ and covenant to always remember him i recall a day when one of our children was leaving for school with his friend i waved goodbye and called out remember who you are as they walked away i overheard the friend ask why does your mother always say that to you what does she mean i heard our sons quick reply she means be good he was exactly right we remember
