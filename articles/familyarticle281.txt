gilead to all of us particularly in helping us at home i know of two visiting teachers who had barely begun talking to a sister in her home when her two teenage daughters bounced in announcing they were going to young women her husband who also was leaving for an evening of meetings detained their threeyearold son who was determined to accompany his older sisters two other girls were arguing in the next room over which video to watch when all the doors closed the mother started to cry it had been she explained a long week the visiting teachers wisely gave this very busy wife and mother a chance to talk she discussed her week and how much she was missing her recently deceased mother the three talked and shared their understanding of the gospel and the difficulties of every day application the visiting teachersone is single and has no children and the other is a single parentpraised their sister for all she was doing to raise her family well the mother felt better the visiting teachers grew closer to each other and to this dear sister they all felt better in the true spirit of relief society these visiting teachers strengthened this sister and her home i feel better why because this story witnesses what i knowthat relief society is indeed a balm that unites us that helps us in our families sisters i testify to you that one of our most important roles as relief society members is to strengthen each other so all of us are better able to help our families we come together we learn from each other we go home and strengthen our families its that simple yet how profound it is that we have this organization to be our balm of gilead president boyd k packer in a talk to the women of the church quoted the first presidency we ask our sisters of the relief society never to forget that they are a unique organization in the whole world for they were organized under the inspiration of the lord no other womens organization in all the earth has had such a birth ensign nov 1980 p 111 that divine direction continues today as priesthood leaders counsel with us give us guidance encouragement and inspiration i am grateful for our prophet gordon b hinckley and for the general authorities of this church who reverence the work of relief society we honor the trust we have been given to show charity to build individual testimonies of the gospel of jesus christ to strengthen the families of the church and focus on living the gospel we do it in our meetings in our homes in our associations this spiritual perspective is the balm of gilead that ameliorating influence spoken of by president monson that brings peace to the soul we carry this balm with us all the time and it makes the difference spiritual peace is in short supply these days for many in the world this is a time of confusion mixed signals scrambled priorities there will always be problems and pressing issues to draw our attention from the work of the lord remember relief society is the lords organization for women it is much more than a class we attend on sunday service in relief society magnifies every sister a sister from virginia wrote i have served in almost all of the callings in relief society and obtained a deep love for this auxiliary which has helped to educate me in several ways i see those years as the most spiritual and enjoyable of my experience in the church relief society has taught me that i am a person of worth loretta h ison big stone gap virginia in relief society we hold constant the virtues relating to women mothers families and righteous living at peace with this goddefined direction relief society sisters can bring this balm of gilead to troubled times we have the spiritual resources of faith hope and compassion to apply as the balm in ancient days the balm of gilead was an aromatic spice used to heal and soothe made from a bush or a tree that grew plentifully around gilead it was a popularly traded commodity always in high demand the strength of the balm is familiar to us through the words of a hymn there is a balm in gilead to make the wounded whole there is a balm in gilead to heal the sin sick soul recreational songs 1949 p 130 as a presidency we desire that every sister in the church recognize the significance of her service and be magnified in her work in the kingdom of god on earth sisters ours is a sacred calling as we devote ourselves to the purposes of relief society we will see many of the problems reversed that are plaguing our homes and our communities the very name relief society describes our purpose to provide relief while we often have the desire and the natural tendency as women to fix whats broken we are not the solution society we are the relief society we understand the power and strength of the fruits of the spirit described in galatians love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith gal 522 emphasis added we can soothe a suffering heart when we cant eliminate the trouble we can bring reassurance and support kindness and calm when the prophet joseph smith was suffering in liberty jail he wrote of the balm he received from his friends he said those who have not been enclosed in the walls of prison without cause can have but little idea how sweet the voice of a friend is one token of friendship from any source whatever awakens and calls into action every sympathetic feeling then the voice of inspiration steals along and whispers peace be unto thy soul history of the church 3293 joseph recognized the role each of us plays in lifting helping and soothing so that the calamities of life can be stilled and the lords voice can be heard this is the balm applied by the women of relief society today in our worldwide church there are countless numbers of sisters who put their families first women who read and ponder the scriptures who follow the counsel of the living prophets women who are serving in demanding callings from setting up wilderness camps for laurels to teaching the articles of faith to primary children to greeting at the door of relief society on sunday morning and the world is blessed by their influence so much of our contribution is done in quiet ways one sister at a time it has always been so i think of mary who bathed christs feet after his hot and dusty journey and then dried his feet with her hair before applying a healing ointment see john 123 i think of dorcas sometimes called the relief society sister of the new testament because her life through her good deeds prompted the women to weep and wail at her passing they pleaded with peter to restore her to life see acts 93639 i think of helen who works with me at the general relief society offices untiring patient accommodating of all helen is a source of peace she gives me comfort because i know she is always there even and fine i have been privileged to meet many of you thank you for the steadfast love you extend to one another for your example for your service thank you for putting your arms around each other and drawing each other into the circle of sisters that is the heart and soul of a branch a ward or a stake the fifth general president of relief society emmeline b wells described the influence of the sisters when she said the sun never sets on the relief society rs reports alpine stake womans exponent aug 1904 p 21 i have been to relief society gatherings in many parts of the world and i know that the lord has no finer forces than the good women in these congregations our balm of gilead takes many forms for we minister with both our hearts and our hands i remember receiving a report from a sister in georgia assigned to survey the damage done to homes in her stake after severe flooding in their area she went into the kitchen of one home sloshing through mud above her ankles and opened a cupboard inside was coiled a water moccasin snake she quickly shut the door and tried another cupboard where she was eyetoeye with yet another snake in consternation she ran up the stairs to the second floor where she met up with an alligator id class that as heroic charity a mother in north carolina who had been cared for by willing relief society sisters during an illness said the sisters have taught me a lesson about the worth of a soul and that even at the bottom stripped of all roles titles and responsibilities we are valuable to our father in heaven and to each other and that charity never faileth wherever we are we can carry with us a reserve of our balm of gilead and we can spread it around it can be as simple as finding a seat in the room by someone who needs you it may be a thoughtful comment in a lesson that answers another ones prayer it may be catching someones eye lifting a child for a drink from a fountain sending a note in the mail reading the scriptures with someone or it may be visiting someone youve missed at meetings someone you hear mentioned in your heart by the still small voice these little actions inspire us they take the edges off our problems indeed out of small things proceedeth that which is great dc 6433 the giver and the receiver are both blessed our strength as relief society sisters in the gospel is most visible and most critical at home women are the heart of the home whatever your circumstance you are the heart of your home i call on you to sanctify your home to make strengthening and nurturing your family your first priority my sister and i speak often about the family in which we grew up we were born of goodly parents my mother was a devoted member of the relief society in cardston alberta canada as i was growing up i felt the influence of the relief society sisters in my ward i realize now that they were one of the constants in my life my dear father had an unwavering testimony and at age eightyeight he gave me his final priesthood blessing our grandparents lived just next door something that doesnt happen much anymore my grandfather served as the stake patriarch and i served as his transcriber what a rich blessing that was in my life my sister jean and i have happy peaceful memories of our years at home homes can be sacred havens from the world homes offer not only physical shelter but a feeling of security a sense of belonging a closeness with other family members families live in homes families are made up of mothers daughters sisters aunts and grandmothers they also have grandfathers uncles brothers sons and fathers families bring us our greatest joys and sometimes our most wrenching heartaches families provide a learning environment a schoolroom from which we never graduate but can always learn in our families we learn to appreciate the spiritual peace that comes from applying the principles of charity of patience sharing integrity kindness generosity selfcontrol and service these are more than family values sisters these are the lords way of life the purpose of the relief society organization of the church stated in our handbook is to help women and their families come unto christ this means bringing the influence of jesus christ into our homes it means we focus on his gospel and we find joy in living his commandments it means we reexamine our time commitments and give emphasis to becoming a family that is united and at peace its no news to you that this is no easy job all forms of the media comment on the fragmentation or even the demise of the family economic pressures force families to make difficult choices were pulled in myriad directions and yet we must hold gospel principles firmly in place our efforts may seem unnoticed and unappreciated but sisters they are worth it families are the framework of our lives here and in the eternities that families are sealed together indicates their central purpose in the lords plan and women have a key role in the family we set the tone in our homes we set the pattern for daily living we set the standards for how people are treated we are teacher counselor confidante advocate supporter and companion we have a long and significant track record in relief society for putting families first the mothers class was the first standardized lesson taught in relief society starting in 1901 these lessons were the original mother education course the intent was to help sisters manage their homes inspire their children teach the gospel and live exemplary lives just as we do now in our relief society today we study one lesson a month and focus it on the needs of homes and families but it doesnt stop there homes and families are a central frame of reference in all lessons because families are close to our hearts they make us hurt sometimes take lehi and sariah as an example how did they feel about the constant bickering of laman and lemuel when joseph was sold into egypt what did he think of his brothers did queen esther really want to hear from her uncle mordecai who knoweth whether thou art come for such a time as this esth 414 families signify responsibility to and for each other this spring my sevenyearold grandson david called to see if i could come to his classs spring concert because he said i have a solo part it was on a tuesday my busiest day but i promised i would try on the day of the program i was there straining with his parents to identify our little david amidst the sea of faces framed by mickey mouse ears david did have a solo every child in the class had a solo but the reward came at the end of the program when he bounded down the aisle saying grandma i knew youd come a friend spoke to me recently of her father who had suffered a stroke she faced a hard time of life as she tried to determine the best way to care for and support him and also consider her mother who had good health and days still filled with promise and grandchildren then my friend spoke of the reverence she felt for this time she said i am finding i enjoy learning from him watching him deal with this difficult process of an aging body at the most difficult times our families can hold us steady we learn this well from one of the most wrenching experiences in the history of the world the crucifixion of jesus christ the son of god we read in john there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mothers sister john 1925 they were there as they had been throughout his life my mind darts back to the early years as mary and joseph raised this most remarkable child i can hear mary comforting the baby jesus with soothing words that come so naturally to us im right here and then at this most dramatic moment of all time there was the mother mary she couldnt soothe his pain this time but she could stand by his side jesus in tribute offered those grand words woman behold thy son then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother john 192627 my sisters of relief society we are the bearers of the balm of gilead may your relief society sisterhood soothe and bless you may you know how i support you in all you do for and with your families may you feel the ameliorating influence the balm of relief society i leave you with my testimony that god lives that jesus christ is his son and that his gospel has been restored in these latter days in the name of jesus christ amen
