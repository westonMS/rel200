easter reflections by elder andrew w peterson of the seventy imageelder andrew w peterson in two weeks we will celebrate easter our thoughts and feelings will hopefully focus on jesus christ for many people this will be another easter that will casually come and casually go for some this easter will be a season of meditation reflection and appreciation there is one special easter that i vividly recall experienced twentyseven years ago as a missionary serving in the north argentine mission our mission had sent missionaries into southern bolivia that easter sunday 1968 i spent in quiriza bolivia a small village nestled in the foothills of the altiplano of southern bolivia i remember the preparations made by the villagers for that easter the mood the music the feel of that moment still linger with me to this day early on easter sunday morning elder arce asked me if i would accompany him to visit an investigator family shortly thereafter we walked down the dirt streets of that small village with adobe homes lining the way we visited an investigator family reviewing important questions such as where do we come from why are we here and where are we going we drew pictures with our fingers in the dirt floor the spirit was present a baptismal invitation was extended and accepted a beautiful baptismal service was held that afternoon we baptized in the nearby muddy waters of the san juan de oro river seasons are reversed in south america when it is springtime here it is fall there those being baptized disappeared behind large freshly cut stacks of cornstalks only to reappear dressed in beautiful white baptismal clothing their brown skin black hair and radiant smiles still linger to this day in my minds eye the power of that easter sunday still moistens my eyes as i reflect on the universality of christs invitation to all to come unto him for me to have administered in his name as a missionary among those people prompted thoughts of jesus talking to his disciples during his earthly ministry he said and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd john 1016 before we left quiriza bolivia for argentina a special prayer was offered accompanied by a dear missionary companion kneeling on a dirt soccer field under the stars the two of us took turns pouring out our hearts to our heavenly father there were expressions of love and gratitude for the people for our mission president and for the privilege of being missionaries promises were made to help the people the years since my mission have provided opportunities for the fulfillment of those missionary promises i returned home to marry my high school sweetheart christine swensen she is a wonderful companion and i love her dearly as a registered nurse she worked helping us to get through dental school as school was drawing to a close and our sixth wedding anniversary was upon us we were still without children then a door opened and an opportunity presented itself and ashley came into our lives our dear precious ashley a year later we traveled to bolivia to bring joshua home from an orphanage he was two years old i can still see that beautiful little boy walking to me with outstretched arms saying papa papa megan then joined us not even twentyfour hours old when we brought her home then back to bolivia for daniel five months old when we held him for the first time several years later while i was presiding over the mexico merida mission jennifer joined our familya beautiful twoweekold guatemalan baby girl born in mexico she opened the hearts of our missionaries and members in southern mexico natalie joy came into our family three weeks before our mission ended her middle name joy is an eternal reminder of the witness we received that she should be included in our family after sixteen years of marriage and six adoptions anne and andrew naturally joined our family to the joy and happiness of their brothers and sisters as a family we are forever grateful for the binding and sealing effect the temple provides for the members of jesus christs church with special promises made to the lord under the stars in bolivia at easter time 1968 there is not a day goes by but that chris and i embrace our children and feel of gods love for all of his children and now as with easter 1968 for me easter season 1995 will be one never to be forgotten six months ago as members of the church we sustained president howard w hunter as the fourteenth president of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints i was sustained in that conference as a new seventy in early march president hunter passed away my mind is fresh with remembrances of him we will never forget president hunter telling our children at the time i was set apart we love you we want you to feel comfortable around us we want you to feel like we are family following our setting apart president hunter and his counselors president hinckley and president monson shook hands with each of our children a treasured moment six months following that setting apart i now stand before you for the first time to speak as a general authority in the tabernacle and president gordon b hinckley has been sustained as the fifteenth president of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints during a visit twentyseven years ago to south america elder gordon b hinckley spoke to missionaries he was younger then he had served but seven years as an apostle he shared a scripture and extended an invitation he taught from 2 timothy for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord 2 tim 178 elder hinckley invited missionaries to not fear and not be ashamed of their testimonies of jesus christ his invitation penetrated my heart as a missionary then and is equally important to me and to you this day the lord has raised up a new prophetone who has no fear one who is full of power and love and of a sound mind and one who by example reminds us never to be ashamed of our testimony of the lord may this be an easter season of meditation reflection and appreciation may we resolve to be obedient to prophetic invitations from those who hold the keys of the kingdom a favorite hymn says there is sunshine in my soul today more glorious and bright than glows in any earthly sky for jesus is my light hymns 1985 no 227 jesus is my light in the name of jesus christ amen
