deny yourselves of all ungodliness by elder neal a maxwell of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder neal a maxwell i join in welcoming elder henry b eyring to the quorum of the twelve apostles who are so ably presided over by president boyd k packer elder eyring is a special blend of brightness and sweetness i am delighted to sustain president james e faust my seatmate of fourteen years and for over thirty years a companion in various civic chores and church assignments i have been blessed with five wonderful sisters but no brothers president faust has been that kind of brother to me for many years i renew my appreciation in sustaining vote for president thomas s monson who over that same span of time has given me opportunities has tutored me and has encouraged me he is sometimes best known for feats of memory but his quiet acts of kindness are much more important in 1935 a returning missionary elder gordon b hinckley was asked to visit with the first presidency because of his special work in the british isles his fifteenminute appointment soon stretched to nearly an hour and a half impressed the first presidency requested him to help with missionary work and he has scarcely left the church administration building since then only now he sits humbly in the center chair in the first presidency council room to which he came humbly sixty years ago president hinckley is a special blend of the practical and the spiritual possessing a keen mind furnished with fixed principles when we rightly describe him as having good judgment good humor goodwill and as being a good listener the common adjective is good goodness is thus the key to so much of what makes up president hinckley whom i am delighted to sustain as our president prophet seer and revelator the high calling which has come after such unusual preparation of this exceptional disciple of christ jesus instructions concerning discipleship involve both substance and sequence if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me luke 923 emphasis added elsewhere moroni declared the need for us to deny ourselves all ungodliness moro 1032 thus including both large and small sins while boulders surely block our way loose gravel slows discipleship too even a small stone can become a stumbling block king benjamin and paul both stressed the congenital weakness of the natural man who is turned away from god and who regards spiritual things as foolishness see mosiah 319 1 cor 21314 col 39 thus putting off the views and appetites of the natural man is such a large part of denying oneself a process sometimes accompanied by scalding shame and the reflux of regret see jst luke 1428 even so in todays world individual appetites far from being denied are actually celebrated as one writer noted this mantra has its own incessant beat and it goes me me me me david frum dead right new york basicbooks 1994 p 203 quoting tom wolfe the me decade and the third great awakening in purple decades new york farrar straus giroux 1982 p 293 yet sensory happiness is illusory happiness even legitimate pleasure is as transitory as the things which produce it while joy is as lasting as the things which produce it of all todays malevolent isms hedonism takes the greatest toll it is naive to say that hedonists merely march to the beat of a different drummer so did the gadarene swine a quarter of a century ago historian john lukacs perceptively warned that sexual immorality was not merely a marginal development but instead was at the center of the moral crisis of our time see john lukacs the passing of the modern age new york harper row publishers 1970 p 169 some thought lukacs was overstating it but consider the subsequent and sobering tragedy of children having children of unwed mothers of children without parents of hundreds of thousands of fatherless children and of rampant spousal infidelity these and related consequences threaten to abort societys future even before the future arrives yet carnalists are unwilling to deny themselves even though all of society suffers from an awful avalanche of consequences consider this sobering forecast about 40 percent of us children will go to sleep in homes in which their fathers do not live david blankenhorn life without father usa weekend 26 feb 1995 pp 67 some estimate this will rise to 60 percent this same commentator has written fatherlessness is the engine driving our most urgent social problems from crime to adolescent pregnancy to domestic violence ibid p 7 such outcomes brothers and sisters unfortunately constitute americas grossest national product produced in the slums of the spirit created by spreading secularism in proverbs we read for the commandment is a lamp prov 623 once darkened a society loses its capacity to distinguish between right and wrong and the will to declare that some things are wrong per se without the lamp our world finds itself desperately building temporary defenses drawing new lines forever falling back unwilling to confront a society which permits anything will eventually lose everything therefore recognized or not the public has an enormous stake in private morality yet today there is so much hedonism and shouted justification with so little quiet shame bad deeds are viewed as nobodys fault and everything as excusable on one basis or another amid such inversions no wonder victims are often neglected and the guilty sometimes glorified likewise in place of real confessions there are fluid variations of i hope i can forgive myself in contrast the inquiring apostles knew the direction in which they faced all anxiously asked jesus of the impending betrayal lord is it i matt 2622 gross sins arise ominously and steadily out of the swamp of selfindulgence and selfpity but the smaller sins breed there too like insects in the mud including the coarsening of language but why should we expect those who mind the things of the flesh to mind their tongues rom 85 for some their god is their belly as are other forms of anatomical allegiance philip 319 a few hedonists actually glory in their shame and there is even a greediness in their uncleanness eph 41819 sadly too a few envy the wicked still others complain that the wicked seem to get away with it see prov 2317 mal 31415 ironically in all their eagerness to experience certain things hedonists become desensitized people who wrongly celebrate their capacity to feel finally reach a point where they lose much of their capacity to feel in the words of three different prophets such individuals become past feeling see 1 ne 1745 eph 419 moro 920 when people proceed without principle erelong they will be without civilization without mercy and past feeling see moro 91120 such individuals do not experience real joy such as being quietly and deeply grateful to a generous god or of helping to restore those who droop in sin 2 ne 428 or of gladly forgoing praise and recognition so that it might flow instead to parched souls our physical as well as our familial environment is likewise threatened by selfishness but some worry only about holes in the ozone layer while the fabric of many families who lack the lamp resembles swiss cheese of course we cant wave a wand and fix families instantly some levees and sandbags must be placed downstream but the real problem lies at the family fountainhead many things will not get better until we have better families but this will require much more selfdenial not less most major social and political problems simply cannot be solved without large doses of selfdenial ironically this is a quality best developed in loving families where the lamp is lit meanwhile mortals remain free to choose between the things of the moment and the things of eternity see 2 ne 227 given the choices made by some we all end up with more protected pornography than protected children of course better selfrestraint than censorship but urging selfrestraint on hedonists is like discouraging dracula from hanging around the blood bank no wonder most of the ten commandments are selfdenying thou shalt nots heavenly father loves his children perfectly but he knows our tendencies perfectly too to lie steal murder envy to be sexually immoral neglect parents break the sabbath and to bear false witnessall occur because one mistakenly seeks to please himself for the moment regardless of divine standards or human consequences as prophesied ethical relativism is now in steep crescendo every man walketh in his own way and after the image of his own god whose image is in the likeness of the world dc 116 without the lamps perspective gross distortion results see jacob 413 i remember reading that one nazi leader used to listen to haydns music while watching jewish people being gassed he was probably proud of his music appreciation mussolini is said to have made italys trains run on time a genuine convenience to passengers but scarcely compensation for the awful consequences of his totalitarian rule and the tens of thousands of lives lost thereby we all admire young david for taking on the mocking goliath but davids act of earlier bravery cannot compensate for his later adultery with the wife of uriah all things considered brothers and sisters to whom did david deal the greater blow goliath or uriah or himself in the same vein gods second commandment love thy neighbor clearly leaves no room for racism yet it is not enough to be free of racism if one is simultaneously enslaved by other appetites jesus emphasized the need for proportion saying there are weightier matters even among good things matt 2323 to the commandmentkeeping young man jesus responded one thing thou lackest referring to an errant attachment to material possessions mark 1021 most of us lack more than just one thing as we come closer to the lord he has promised to show unto us our weakness ether 1227 hence general goodness is no excuse for failing to work on those things which we yet lack any list of our present personal indulgences is actually an indexbut a reverse index to joysjoys we will not experience until we do deny ourselves certain things meanwhile the absence of gross sins in our lives can lull us into slackness concerning seemingly small sins the failure to visit and care for parents is a failure to honor ones father and mother in its lesser form the lack of selfrestraint causes unkind comments to a spouse but in the extreme it can bring domestic abuse and even murder the tendency to strike back whenever we are offended makes us brusque and rude as if others were functions not as brothers and sisters thus excess of ego is like a spreading toxic spill from which flow all the deadly sins see prov 61619 young parents know how a mere half cup of spilled milk seems to cover half a kitchen floor small sins spread like that too with his perfect spiritual symmetry jesus really is the way the truth and the life his way being in such sharp contrast to the worlds ways john 146 jesus perfect character is thus not only holy but wholly complete and finished without jesus supernal character he could not have accomplished the astonishing atonement and he has asked us to become much more like him see matt 548 3 ne 1248 3 ne 2727 though heavy discipleships burden can be made light see matt 1130 the lord can ease the burdens andor our shoulders can be made strong enough that we may be able to bear it mosiah 2414 1 cor 1013 so it is that real personal sacrifice never was placing an animal on the altar instead it is a willingness to put the animal in us upon the altar and letting it be consumed such is the sacrifice unto the lord of a broken heart and a contrite spirit dc 598 a prerequisite to taking up the cross while giving away all our sins in order to know god alma 2218 for the denial of self precedes the full acceptance of him in the name of jesus christ amen
