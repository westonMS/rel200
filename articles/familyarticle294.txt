a table encircled with love by elder legrand r curtis of the seventy imageelder legrand r curtis much has been written about the importance of the home elder marion g romney has told us that at the heart of societys fatal sickness is the instability of the family1 we recognize that some homes are large graciously appointed even luxurious others are very small and humble with scant furnishings yet each and every home can be a heavn on earth when we are filled with love where we want to be hymns 1985 no 298 as one of our beloved hymns reminds us one of the more important furnishings found in most homes is the kitchen table now it may be small it may be large or in the form of a little counter with barely room to put the food and utensils its major function seems to be a place for the different members of the family to receive nourishment on this special occasion my desire is to bring your attention to a deeper more important function for the kitchen table where we can receive much more than nourishment for our physical wellbeing a family generally has two or more members of differing ages but the family needs to meetpreferably not only just to eat but to pray to talk to listen to relate to learn to grow together president gordon b hinckley has stated it so well my pleaand i wish i were more eloquent in voicing itis a plea to save the children too many of them walk with pain and fear in loneliness and despair children need sunlight they need happiness they need love and nurture they need kindness and refreshment and affection every home regardless of the cost of the house can provide an environment of love which will be an environment of salvation2 most family members are subjected to the many forces of the world outside of the home as well as the powerful influence of radio television videos tapes and many other things which we bring into our homes picture a family gathering around a table perhaps the kitchen table talking about the gospel talking about the sacrament meetings the messages talking about the current ensign or the current new era talking about school with all of its ramifications talking about general conference talking about the sunday school lessons listening to good music talking about jesus christ and his teachings the list could be expanded not only parents but all family members would be wise to make certain that each person present has a chance to talk and ample opportunity to participate think of the potential of a family kneeling around a table without television praying pleading for help thanking our father for blessingsteaching all ages the importance of a loving father in heaven family prayer with little ones may well develop older ones who someday will pray with their families president thomas s monson stated it well the lord directed that we have family prayer when he said pray in your families unto the father always in my name that your wives and your children may be blessed 3 ne 1821 will you join me as we look in on a typical latterday saint family offering prayers unto the lord father mother and each of the children kneel bow their heads and close their eyes a sweet spirit of love unity and peace fills the home as a father hears his tiny son pray unto god that his dad will do the right things and be obedient to the lords bidding do you think that such a father would find it difficult to honor the prayer of his precious son as a teenage daughter hears her sweet mother plead unto the lord that her daughter will be inspired in the selection of her companions that she will prepare herself for a temple marriage dont you believe that such a daughter will seek to honor this humble pleading petition of her mother whom she so dearly loves when father mother and each of the children earnestly pray that these fine sons in the family will live worthy that they may in due time receive a call to serve as ambassadors of the lord in the mission fields of the church dont we begin to see how such sons grow to young manhood with an overwhelming desire to serve as missionaries3 as many have said how could you possibly send your parents and your children out into the world each day without gathering together and talking to the lord wise parents will examine their schedules and plan at least one time daily to gather the family for the blessings of prayer very soon young members learn how to take their turn and learn the precious values found in family prayer i have stated before that home should be a happy place because all work to keep it that way it is said that happiness is homemade and we should endeavor to make our homes happy and pleasant places for us and our children a happy home is one centered around the teachings of the gospel and this takes constant careful effort by all concerned4 a busy teenager in a rather large family complained about the amount of time that family prayer was taking as the wise mother was praying the next day she intentionally left that youngster out of the prayer as the prayer concluded the busy child said mother you left me out of the prayer the loving mother explained that she was just responding to the youngsters complaint the busy child complained dont leave me out visualize a family surrounding a table with the scriptures open discussing the many truths and lessons to absorb this indeed is a table encircled with love educators agree that children need to read much more outside of school we can bless our children by reading the scriptures with them on a daily basisat the kitchen table to have a time when the family meets at the kitchen table may take considerable adjustment and careful planning but what could be of more importance to the unity of the family the spiritual growth of the family the bridges built between members of a family as they talk listen and respond surrounded by love our major success is simply tryingover and over there are many forces in the world today seeking to decimate the family and the home wise parents will strive to strengthen family ties increase spirituality in the home and focus on jesus christ and temple activity president hunter has told us i pray that we might treat each other with more kindness more courtesy more humility and patience and forgiveness secondly and in that same spirit i also invite the members of the church to establish the temple of the lord as the great symbol of their membership and the supernal setting for their most sacred covenants it would be the deepest desire of my heart to have every member of the church temple worthy5 the direction given by president hunter can be markedly enhanced by what takes place around the kitchen table in our homes we should practice how to treat others as goethe said so well if you treat an individual as he is he will stay as he is but if you treat him as if he were what he could be and might be he will become what he ought to be6 president boyd k packer stated to bring some of the things of heaven into the home is to insure that family members will graduate to church participation the family home evening is of course readymade for thisa meeting at home that can be organized to fit every need and its just as much a church meeting or can be as those held at the chapel7 this counsel also agrees with what elder dean l larsen has told us our church buildings are not the only places where we can worship our homes should also be places of devotion it would be well if each day we could go home to church there should be no other place where the spirit of the lord is more welcome and more easily accessible than in our own homes8 as we work to accomplish all of this in our homes we will do well to remember the important statement of president harold b lee remember that the most important of the lords work that you and i will ever do will be within the walls of our own home9 my plea today is that each of us will look carefully at our homes and at the kitchen table and continually strive to bring heaven into our homes and come unto jesus christ in the name of jesus christ amen notes ensign feb 1972 p 57 ensign nov 1994 p 54 pathways to perfection salt lake city
