make thee an ark by elder w don ladd of the seventy imageelder w don ladd there are so many kinds of voices in the world said the apostle paul to the corinthians two thousand years ago 1 cor 1410 they seemed to be troubled by the same conflicting messages we hear today and it can be frightening when you consider how fragile and fickle the fabric of our society really is there have always been strident sounds and discordant voices and our day is no exception every day in the newspapers over television in movies and magazines we are bombarded with violence and immorality clothed in the enticing voices of permissiveness in his sermon on the mount the master admonished take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof matt 634 sufficient indeed is the evil thereof unto this day in which we live there seems to be a rising tide of evil a flood of iniquity spreading throughout the world crime and violence are increasing at an alarming rate fear openly stalks our streets and invades our homes it has been said that you can tell the ideals of a nation by its advertisements and many of the ones i see do not speak well of us someone said there was a time when movies were rated on how good they were not on who was allowed to see them according to the book of mormon the devil seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself 2 ne 227 the evidence of his handiwork is certainly about us elder richard l evans once said if we dont change direction we will arrive at where we are going richard evans quote book salt lake city publishers press 1971 p 244 it is not in idleness that our prophets admonish again and again to strengthen ourselves and our familiesto hold family home evenings to read and study the scriptures to have daily personal and family prayers and to quote our prophet howard w hunter to treat each other with more kindness more courtesy more humility and patience and forgiveness ensign july 1994 p 4 the immoral influences of the world are especially destructive to children but our children like ourselves arent going to live in a vacuum they never have and they never will in all their growing and developing we can do much to help them to protect them and to guide them but we cannot isolate them from the influences of their own time and generation there will be times when other voices are in their ears when other hands are on their shoulders and when they are away from home we would do well then while ours is still the strongest influence in their lives to give them a sure set of standards and a firm foundation of safe and sound principles the lord said to noah make thee an ark and with thee will i establish my covenant gen 614 18 and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him and noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark gen 75 23 we all need to build a personal ark to fortify ourselves against this rising tide of evil to protect ourselves and our families against the floodwaters of iniquity around us and we shouldnt wait until it starts raining but prepare in advance this has been the message of all the prophets in this dispensation including president hunter as well as the prophets of old unfortunately we dont always heed the clear warnings of our prophets we coast complacently along until calamity strikes and then we panic when it starts raining it is too late to begin building the ark however we do need to listen to the lords spokesmen we need to calmly continue to move ahead and to prepare for what will surely come we need not panic or fear for if we are prepared spiritually and temporally we and our families will survive any flood our arks will float on a sea of faith if our works have been steadily and surely preparing for the future the key is to accept the invitation of our prophet whom we sustained this morning to live with ever more attention to the life and example of the lord jesus christ especially the love and hope and compassion he displayed ensign july 1994 p 4 the most important thing we can doyoung or oldis develop a personal relationship with jesus christ if we do we will always be comfortable with ourselves any questions of selfesteem and selfworth will diminish and we will have a quiet confidence that will see us through any trial and the saviors promise to us is fear not little children for you are mine and i have overcome the world dc 5041 whatever the anxiety or fear or frustration we have only to remember the lords comforting words to the prophet joseph smith in the liberty jail my son peace be unto thy soul dc 1217 to each of us he will always be there to say my son my daughter my child peace be unto thy soul and in return we should pledge as did the poet george herbert sevn whole dayes not one in seven i will praise thee evn eternitie is too short to extoll thee praise ii the works of george herbert ed f d hutchinson oxford oxford university press 1971 p 146 my brothers and sisters i bear you my witness that jesus is the christ that he indeed overcame the world through his atonement and that he will always be there to comfort us if we will follow his example and do the will of the father and i do so in the name of jesus christ amen
