let us build fortresses by elder horacio a tenorio recently released member of the seventy imageelder horacio a tenorio in our world of escalating crisis where the fraternal wars corruption secret combinations and immorality are reminiscent of the wickedness described in the book of mormon satan has intensified his efforts to destroy the family by corrupting the youth and robbing childhood of its innocence our youth are especially vulnerable as the enemy cunningly utilizes every means at his disposal including the mass media and changes in constitutional law to deceive them he bombards our homes with enticements of destructive and harmful products and morals through television videos press books etc we as latterday saints and all good people anywhere must conscientiously screen what comes into our homes parents have the inalienable right and the responsibility to educate their children no inappropriate outsider should be allowed to dictate our familys values nor what our children are being taught the gospel is based on the principle of agency and our heavenly father has made us responsible for raising our families in such a way that they can be saved and return to his presence in section 68 of the doctrine and covenants verse 25 the lord tells us inasmuch as parents have children in zion or in any of her stakes which are organized that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance faith in christ the son of the living god and of baptism and the gift of the holy ghost by the laying on of the hands the sin be upon the heads of the parents dc 6825 in medieval times great fortresses were built around castles or cities to protect them from enemy attacks in the book of mormon the nephites built fortresses to defend their families against their enemies we must make of our homes fortresses to protect our families against the constant attacks of the adversary i am not suggesting that we isolate ourselves from the world by digging deep moats or constructing barriers several meters high around our homes but rather that in our family councils under the influence of the spirit we establish the activities entertainment books friendships rules and habits that will constitute our fortresses our fortress consists of teaching our children the gospel through the scriptures establishing the habit of reading them every day as a family and basing a large part of our conversations on them it means kneeling together daily to pray and to teach our children the importance of direct personal communication with our heavenly father our fortress is erected by showing our children through our example that the principles and teachings of the gospel are a way of life which helps us find peace and happiness on this earth and provides the strength necessary to withstand the trials and tribulations that come into our lives we must teach our children to avoid compromising themselves with inappropriate fashions and negative practices of the world by simply saying no when confronted with them creating a fortress requires the family to counsel together in weekly family home evenings where they make decisions and agreements in ancient times a fortress required regular inspections to ensure that no weak spots developed that an enemy could take advantage of and guards in the watchtowers ensured that no enemy could approach undetected in other words once a city was fortified a constant effort was made to maintain the fortress so that it could serve its purpose by establishing a security system of our own we can prevent the enemy from finding and exploiting weaknesses in our family fortress through which he could gain access to and harm our most precious treasure our family one of the watchtowers on our fortress can be the regular habit of a fathers interview with each member of his family personal interviews are an important resource in maintaining the integrity of our fortress through them we become better acquainted with our children learn about their problems and concerns and establish open communication and trust that will enable us to foresee any danger help them make decisions and support them during difficult times as parents our heavenly father has given us the stewardship of caring for and protecting our families it is a responsibility that we cannot and must not delegate in doctrine and covenants section 93 verses 39 and 40 it says and that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth through disobedience from the children of men and because of the tradition of their fathers but i have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth dc 933940 a loving interview guided by the spirit can give direction to our childrens lives bring about necessary adjustments or changes and may even result in miracles i wish to share with you a very special family experience this is an interview i had with my grandson several years ago when i was preparing myself spiritually in prayer to interview one of my daughters i felt inspired to interview kemish my grandson who was a little over three years old and was living with us kemish was a bundle of energy and could not stay quiet for more than a minute always running jumping and playing so i let that feeling pass thinking that i would wait until he was a little older and able to pay attention several months later while praying the feeling came again only this time it was stronger and i heeded it i went to kemish and told him tomorrow you and i will have an interview the next day at the beginning of the interview i told him that during an interview we had to look each other in the eye and remain seated all the time among other things it was a real miracle kemish sat and stayed quiet for almost ten minutes but more marvelous than that however was that i got to know his thoughts and feelings the thing that worried him the most was when he could get a twowheel bicycle when i explained to him that he would have to wait until he was a little older he understood perfectly he then told me the story he had learned about nephi and his brothers but the greatest thrill for me as his grandfather was when he told me that he knew who jesus christ was and bore his testimony of the savior to me nowhere could you ever find more truth and purity than in the testimony of a threeyearold boy i can picture an interview with my heavenly father before coming to this earthan interview in which he called to me and spoke to me showing me what he had in store for me it must have been a tender interview with a loving father who was about to let his son go for a time i anxiously await my next interview i know we have a loving father who is waiting for us i know that he instructs us through his only begotten our savior and redeemer i know that his church and his gospel are real fortresses which will give peace and security to our most precious treasure on this earth our family of this i testify in the name of our lord jesus christ amen
