this evening in this general priesthood meeting the priesthood is the greatest brotherhood on the earth i feel great strength in seeing your faithfulness and feeling your love and sustaining vote we are particularly grateful to have so many of our aaronic priesthood brethren here with their fathers or advisers the subject of my address this evening will be more particularly directed to the husbands and fathers all of you who hold the aaronic priesthood will soon arrive at the years of marriage and fatherhood therefore what i say tonight has application to all present i wish to speak of the relationship that a man holding the priesthood should have with his wife and children with a knowledge of the plan of salvation as a foundation a man who holds the priesthood looks upon marriage as a sacred privilege and obligation it is not good for man nor for woman to be alone man is not complete without woman neither can fill the measure of their creation without the other see 1 cor 1111 moses 318 marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of god see dc 491517 only through the new and everlasting covenant of marriage can they realize the fulness of eternal blessings see dc 13114 dc 1321519 as a matter of priesthood responsibility a man under normal circumstances should not unduly postpone marriage brethren the lord has spoken plainly on this matter it is your sacred and solemn responsibility to follow his counsel and the words of his prophets the prophets of the past have spoken also of those who may not have opportunity to marry in this life president lorenzo snow said there is no latterday saint who dies after having lived a faithful life who will lose anything because of having failed to do certain things when opportunities were not furnished him or her in other words if a young man or a young woman has no opportunity of getting married and they live faithful lives up to the time of their death they will have all the blessings exaltation and glory that any man or woman will have who had this opportunity and improved it that is sure and positive the teachings of lorenzo snow comp clyde j williams salt lake city bookcraft 1984 p 138 i believe president snows statement to be true a man who holds the priesthood shows perfect moral fidelity to his wife and gives her no reason to doubt his faithfulness a husband is to love his wife with all his heart and cleave unto her and none else see dc 422226 president spencer w kimball explained the words none else eliminate everyone and everything the spouse then becomes preeminent in the life of the husband or wife and neither social life nor occupational life nor political life nor any other interest nor person nor thing shall ever take precedence over the companion spouse the miracle of forgiveness salt lake city bookcraft 1969 p 250 the lord forbids and his church condemns any and every intimate relationship outside of marriage infidelity on the part of a man breaks the heart of his wife and loses her confidence and the confidence of his children see jacob 235 be faithful in your marriage covenants in thought word and deed pornography flirtations and unwholesome fantasies erode ones character and strike at the foundation of a happy marriage unity and trust within a marriage are thereby destroyed one who does not control his thoughts and thus commits adultery in his heart if he does not repent shall not have the spirit but shall deny the faith and shall fear see dc 4223 dc 6316 a man who holds the priesthood has reverence for motherhood mothers are given a sacred privilege to bear the souls of men for herein is the work of the father continued that he may be glorified dc 13263 the first presidency has said motherhood is near to divinity it is the highest holiest service to be assumed by mankind in james r clark comp messages of the first presidency 6 vols salt lake city bookcraft 196575 6178 the priesthood cannot work out its destiny nor can gods purposes be fulfilled without our helpmates mothers perform a labor the priesthood cannot do for this gift of life the priesthood should have love unbounded for the mothers of their children honor your wifes unique and divinely appointed role as a mother in israel and her special capacity to bear and nurture children we are under divine commandment to multiply and replenish the earth and to bring up our children and grandchildren in light and truth see moses 228 dc 9340 you share as a loving partner the care of the children help her to manage and keep up your home help teach train and discipline your children you should express regularly to your wife and children your reverence and respect for her indeed one of the greatest things a father can do for his children is to love their mother a man who holds the priesthood regards the family as ordained of god your leadership of the family is your most important and sacred responsibility the family is the most important unit in time and in eternity and as such transcends every other interest in life we reiterate what was stated by president david o mckay no other success in life can compensate for failure in the home david o mckay quoting j e mcculloch home the savior of civilization in conference report apr 1935 p 116 and president harold b lee the most important of the lords work you and i will ever do will be within the walls of our own homes harold b lee stand ye in holy places salt lake city deseret book co 1974 p 255 effective family leadership brethren requires both quantity and quality time the teaching and governance of the family must not be left to your wife alone to society to school or even the church a man who holds the priesthood accepts his wife as a partner in the leadership of the home and family with full knowledge of and full participation in all decisions relating thereto of necessity there must be in the church and in the home a presiding officer see dc 10721 by divine appointment the responsibility to preside in the home rests upon the priesthood holder see moses 422 the lord intended that the wife be a helpmeet for man meet means equalthat is a companion equal and necessary in full partnership presiding in righteousness necessitates a shared responsibility between husband and wife together you act with knowledge and participation in all family matters for a man to operate independent of or without regard to the feelings and counsel of his wife in governing the family is to exercise unrighteous dominion keep yourselves above any domineering or unworthy behavior in the tender intimate relationship between husband and wife because marriage is ordained of god the intimate relationship between husbands and wives is good and honorable in the eyes of god he has commanded that they be one flesh and that they multiply and replenish the earth see moses 228 moses 324 you are to love your wife as christ loved the church and gave himself for it see eph 52531 tenderness and respectnever selfishnessmust be the guiding principles in the intimate relationship between husband and wife each partner must be considerate and sensitive to the others needs and desires any domineering indecent or uncontrolled behavior in the intimate relationship between husband and wife is condemned by the lord any man who abuses or demeans his wife physically or spiritually is guilty of grievous sin and in need of sincere and serious repentance differences should be worked out in love and kindness and with a spirit of mutual reconciliation a man should always speak to his wife lovingly and kindly treating her with the utmost respect marriage is like a tender flower brethren and must be nourished constantly with expressions of love and affection you who hold the priesthood must not be abusive in your relationship with children seek always to employ the principles of priesthood government set forth in the revelations see dc 9340 dc 1213436 4145 president george albert smith wisely counseled we should not lose our tempers and abuse one another nobody ever abused anybody else when he had the spirit of the lord it is always when we have some other spirit in conference report oct 1950 p 8 no man who has been ordained to the priesthood of god can with impunity abuse his wife or child sexual abuse of children has long been a cause for excommunication from the church we encourage you brethren to remember that priesthood is a righteous authority only earn the respect and confidence of your children through your loving relationship with them a righteous father protects his children with his time and presence in their social educational and spiritual activities and responsibilities tender expressions of love and affection toward children are as much the responsibility of the father as the mother tell your children you love them you who hold the priesthood have the responsibility unless disabled to provide temporal support for your wife and children no man can shift the burden of responsibility to another not even to his wife the lord has commanded that women and children have claim on their husbands and fathers for their maintenance see dc 83 1 tim 58 president ezra taft benson has stated that when a husband encourages or insists that his wife work out of the home for their convenience not only will the family suffer in such instances but his own spiritual growth and progression will be hampered ensign nov 1987 p 49 we urge you to do all in your power to allow your wife to remain in the home caring for the children while you provide for the family the best you can we further emphasize that men who abandon their family and fail to meet their responsibility to care for those they have fathered may find their eligibility for a temple recommend and their standing in the church in jeopardy in cases of divorce or separation men must demonstrate that they are meeting family support payments mandated by law and obligated by the principles of the church in order to qualify for the blessings of the lord a man who holds the priesthood leads his family in church participation so they will know the gospel and be under the protection of the covenants and ordinances if you are to enjoy the blessings of the lord you must set your own homes in order together with your wife you determine the spiritual climate of your home your first obligation is to get your own spiritual life in order through regular scriptural study and daily prayer secure and honor your priesthood and temple covenants encourage your family to do the same take seriously your responsibility to teach the gospel to your family through regular family home evening family prayer devotional and scripturereading time and other teaching moments give special emphasis to preparation for missionary service and temple marriage as patriarch in the home exercise your priesthood through performing the appropriate ordinances for your family and by giving blessings to your wife and children next to your own salvation brethren there is nothing so important to you as the salvation of your wife and children brethren i have spoken plainly to you regarding your responsibility as holders of the holy priesthood if there are areas in your life where improvement may be needed i encourage you to make this a matter of prayerful consideration i testify that this is what the lord would have the brethren of the priesthood receive at this time may you be blessed in your efforts to be righteous husbands and fathers i pray as i
