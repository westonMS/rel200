the path to peace by president thomas s monson second counselor in the first presidency imagepresident thomas s monson on this beautiful easter morning prayers of gratitude for the life and mission of our lord and savior jesus christ fill the sabbath air while strains of inspiring music comfort our hearts and whisper to our souls the ageless salutation peace be unto you in a world where peace is such a universal quest we sometimes wonder why violence walks our streets accounts of murder and senseless killings fill the columns of our newspapers and family quarrels and disputes mar the sanctity of the home and smother the tranquillity of so many lives perhaps we stray from the path which leads to peace and find it necessary to pause to ponder and to reflect on the teachings of the prince of peace and determine to incorporate them in our thoughts and actions and to live a higher law walk a more elevated road and be a better disciple of christ the ravages of hunger in somalia the brutality of hate in bosnia and the ethnic struggles across the globe remind us that the peace we seek will not come without effort and determination anger hatred and contention are foes not easily subdued these enemies inevitably leave in their destructive wake tears of sorrow the pain of conflict and the shattered hopes of what could have been their sphere of influence is not restricted to the battlefields of war but can be observed altogether too frequently in the home around the hearth and within the heart so soon do many forget and so late do they remember the counsel of the lord there shall be no disputations among you for verily verily i say unto you he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me but is of the devil who is the father of contention and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger one with another behold this is not my doctrine to stir up the hearts of men with anger one against another but this is my doctrine that such things should be done away1 as we turn backward the clock of time we recall that some fiftyfive years ago a desperately arranged peace a conference of peace convened in the bavarian city of munich leaders of the european powers assembled even as the world tottered on the brink of war their purpose openly stated was to pursue a course which they felt would avert war and maintain peace mistrust intrigue a quest for power doomed to failure that conference the outcome was not peace in our time but rather war and destruction to a degree not previously experienced overlooked or at least set aside was the hauntingly touching appeal of one who had fallen in an earlier war he seemed to be writing in behalf of millions of comradesfriend and foe alike in flanders fields the poppies blow between the crosses row on row that mark our place and in the sky the larks still bravely singing fly scarce heard amid the guns below we are the dead short days ago we lived felt dawn saw sunset glow loved and were loved and now we lie in flanders fields take up our quarrel with the foe to you from failing hands we throw the torch be yours to hold it high if ye break faith with us who die we shall not sleep though poppies grow in flanders fields2 are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past after such a brief interval of peace following world war i came the cataclysm of world war ii in fact this june will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the famed landings of allied forces on the beaches of normandy tens of thousands of dignitaries and veterans will flock to the scene as the landings are reenacted one writer observed lower normandy has more than its share of hallowed dead their bodies lie in graves from falaise to cherbourg 13796 americans 17958 british 8658 canadian 650 polish and around 65000 germansmore than 106000 dead in all and that is just the military all killed in the space of a summer holiday3 similar accounts could be written describing the terrible losses in other theaters of combat in that same conflict the famed statesman william gladstone described the formula for peace when he declared we look forward to the time when the power of love will replace the love of power then will our world know the blessings of peace world peace though a lofty goal is but an outgrowth of the personal peace each individual seeks to attain i speak not of the peace promoted by man but peace as promised of god i speak of peace in our homes peace in our hearts even peace in our lives peace after the way of man is perishable peace after the manner of god will prevail we are reminded that anger doesnt solve anything it builds nothing but it can destroy everything4 the consequences of conflict are so devastating that we yearn for guidanceeven a way to insure our success as we seek the path to peace what is the way to obtain such a universal blessing are there prerequisites let us remember that to obtain gods blessings one must do gods bidding may i suggest three ideas to prompt our thinking and guide our footsteps search inward reach outward and look heavenward first search inward selfevaluation is always a difficult procedure we are so frequently tempted to gloss over areas which demand correction and dwell endlessly on our individual strengths president ezra taft benson counsels us the price of peace is righteousness men and nations may loudly proclaim peace peace but there shall be no peace until individuals nurture in their souls those principles of personal purity integrity and character which foster the development of peace peace cannot be imposed it must come from the lives and hearts of men there is no other way5 elder richard l evans observed to find peacethe peace within the peace that passeth understandingmen must live in honesty honoring each other honoring obligations working willingly loving and cherishing loved ones serving and considering others with patience with virtue with faith and forbearance with the assurance that life is for learning for serving for repenting and improving and god be thanked for the blessed principle of repenting and improving which is a way that is open to us all6 the place of parents in the home and family is of vital importance as we examine our personal responsibilities in this regard recently a distinguished group met in conference to examine the increase of violence in the lives of individuals particularly the young some observations from their deliberations are helpful to us as we examine our priorities a society that views graphic violence as entertainment should not be surprised when senseless violence shatters the dreams of its youngest and brightest unemployment and despair can lead to desperation but most people will not commit desperate acts if they have been taught that dignity honesty and integrity are more important than revenge or rage if they understand that respect and kindness ultimately give one a better chance at success the women of the antiviolence summit have hit on the solutionthe only one that can reverse a downward spiral of destructive behavior and senseless pain a return to oldfashioned family values will work wonders7 so frequently we mistakenly believe that our children need more things when in reality their silent pleadings are simply for more of our time the accumulation of wealth or the multiplication of assets belies the masters teaching lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also8 the other evening i saw large masses of parents and children crossing an intersection in salt lake city en route to the delta center to see the disney on ice production of beauty and the beast i actually pulled my car over to the curb to watch the gleeful throng fathers who i am certain were cajoled into going to the event held tightly in their hands the small and clutching hands of their precious children here was love in action here was an unspoken sermon of caring here was a rearranging of time as a godgiven priority truly peace will reign triumphant when we improve ourselves after the pattern taught by the lord then we will appreciate the deep spirituality hidden behind the simple words of a familiar song there is beauty all around when theres love at home9 second reach outward though exaltation is a personal matter and while individuals are saved not as a group but indeed as individuals yet one cannot live in a vacuum membership in the church calls forth a determination to serve a position of responsibility may not be of recognized importance nor may the reward be broadly known service to be acceptable to the savior must come from willing minds ready hands and pledged hearts occasionally discouragement may darken our pathway frustration may be a constant companion in our ears there may sound the sophistry of satan as he whispers you cannot save the world your small efforts are meaningless you havent time to be concerned for others trusting in the lord let us turn our heads from such falsehoods and make certain our feet are firmly planted in the path of service and our hearts and souls dedicated to follow the example of the lord in moments when the light of resolution dims and when the heart grows faint we can take comfort from his promise be not weary in welldoing out of small things proceedeth that which is great behold the lord requireth the heart and a willing mind10 during the past year the primary organization has conducted an effort to have the children become better acquainted with the holy temples of god frequently this has entailed a visit to the temple grounds the laughter of small children the joy of unfettered youth and the exuberance of energy displayed by them gladdened the heart of this observer as a loving teacher guided a boy or girl to the large door of the salt lake temple and the little one reached out and up to touch the temple i could almost see the master welcoming the little children to his side and could almost hear his comforting words suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god11 number three look heavenward as we do we find it comforting and satisfying to communicate with our heavenly father through prayer that path to spiritual powereven a passport to peace we are reminded of his beloved son the prince of peace that pioneer who literally showed the way for others to follow his divine plan can save us from the babylons of sin complacency and error his example points the way when faced with temptation he shunned it when offered the world he declined it when asked for his life he gave it on one significant occasion jesus took a text from isaiah the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound12a clear pronouncement of the peace that passeth all understanding frequently death comes as an intruder it is an enemy that suddenly appears in the midst of lifes feast putting out its lights and its gaiety death lays its heavy hand upon those dear to us and at times leaves us baffled and wondering in certain situations as in great suffering and illness death comes as an angel of mercy but to those bereaved the masters promise of peace is the comforting balm which heals peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid13 i go to prepare a place for you that where i am there ye may be also14 how i pray that all who have loved then lost might know the reality of the resurrection and have the unshakable knowledge that families can be forever one such was a major sullivan ballou who during the time of the american civil war wrote a touching letter to his wifejust one week before he was killed in the battle of bull run with me feel the love of his soul his trust in god his courage his faith july 14 1861 camp clark washington my very dear sarah the indications are very strong that we shall move in a few daysperhaps tomorrow lest i should not be able to write again i feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall under your eye when i shall be no more i have no misgivings about or lack of confidence in the cause in which i am engaged and my courage does not halt or falter i am perfectly willing to lay down all my joys in this life to help maintain this government sarah my love for you is deathless it seems to bind me with mighty cables that nothing but omnipotence could break and yet my love of country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me unresistibly on with all these chains to the battle field the memories of the blissful moments i have spent with you come creeping over me and i feel most gratified to god and to you that i have enjoyed them so long and hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years when god willing we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grown up to honorable manhood around us i have i know but few and small claims upon divine providence but something whispers to meperhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little edgar that i shall return to my loved ones unharmed if i do not my dear sarah never forget how much i love you and when my last breath escapes me on the battle field it will whisper your name forgive me my faults and the many pains i have caused you how thoughtless and foolish i have oftentimes been how gladly would i wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness but o sarah if the dead can come back to this earth and the unseen around those they loved i shall always be near you in the gladdest days and in the darkest nights always always and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek it shall be my breath as the cool air fans your throbbing temple it shall be my spirit passing by sarah do not mourn me dead think i am gone and wait for thee for we shall meet again15 the darkness of death can ever be dispelled by the light of revealed truth i am the resurrection and the life spoke the master he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die16 added to his own words are those of the angels spoken to the weeping mary magdalene and the other mary as they approached the tomb to care for the body of their lord why seek ye the living among the dead he is not here but is risen17 such is the message of easter morn he lives and because he lives all shall indeed live again this knowledge provides the peace for loved ones of those whose graves are marked by the crosses of normandy those hallowed resting places in flanders fields where the poppies blow in springtime and for those who rest in countless other locations including the depths of the sea oh sweet the joy this sentence gives i know that my redeemer lives18 in the name of jesus christ amen notes 3 ne 112830 john mccrae in flanders fields the best loved poems of the american people sel hazel felleman garden
