take especial care of your family by elder neal a maxwell of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder neal a maxwell during the last days when all things shall be in commotion dc 8891 the restored gospel of jesus christ provides so many essential things including precious perspective of seeing things as they really are jacob 413 the eminent historian will durant wrote of the human need to seize the value and perspective of passing things we want to know that the little things are little and the big things big before it is too late we want to see things now as they will seem foreverin the light of eternity1 the gospels illumination provides so much greater perspective for us concerning the role of the family before citing some challenges to family life consider first brothers and sisters how living without god in the world brings a functional lack of consistent perspective if there were no eternal truths to what principles would mortals look for guidance if not accountable to god to whom are we ultimately accountable furthermore if nothing is ever really wrong then no one is ever really responsible if there are no fixed boundaries then there cannot be any excesses why should we be surprised then at so many disturbing outcomes including the lack of community when every man does that which is right in his own eyes judg 176 judg 2125 and seeks not the righteousness of the lord but instead walks in his own way dc 116 reflect for instance on how inoperative the ten commandments are in many lives today killing stealing and bearing false witness still carry some social stigma and legal sanction but sanction is effectively gone regarding sexual immorality the sabbath day honoring fathers and mothers and the taking of the name of the lord in vain some of this decline represents the bitter harvest of ethical relativism the philosophy of choice of many reflecting no fixed divine truths but merely the mores of the moment no wonder ortega y gasset wisely warned if truth does not exist relativism cannot take itself seriously2 note several terrible trends which if uncorrected will produce an even worse coalition of consequences in ten years onehalf of all children born in america will be illegitimate3 more and more children have no functioning fathers already 70 percent of our juvenile criminals come from fatherless homes4 less than half of all children born today will live continuously with their own mother and father throughout childhood5 onefourth of all adolescents contract a sexually transmitted disease before they graduate from high school6 fiftyfive percent of american children under the age of six have both parents or their only parent working in the labor force7 father lehi once described himself as a trembling parent 2 ne 114 there are trembling parents and grandparents today some of todays families already exist in a worse wilderness than did father lehis healthy traditional families are becoming an endangered species perhaps one day families may even rank with the threatened spotted owl in effective attention given as parenting declines the need for policing increases there will always be a shortage of police if there is a shortage of effective parents likewise there will not be enough prisons if there are not enough good homes there is as we all know much talk about family values but rhetoric by itself cannot bring reform nostalgically many wish for the family life of yesteryear they regard family decline as regrettable but not reversible others genuinely worried over the spilling social consequences are busy placing sandbags downstream even when the frenzied use of sandbags often destroys what little is left of family gardens a few regard the family as an institution to be drastically redefined or even to be rid of there are no perfect families either in the world or in the church but there are many good families my spiritual applause also goes to those heroic parentsleft alone by death or divorcewho are righteously and anxiously engaged in nurturing and providing for their families often against such heavy odds alas in some families things do go wretchedly wrong but these gross failures are no reason to denigrate further the institution of the family we should make course corrections and fix the leaks not abandon ship much modern despair and violence grow out of unhealthy attitudes towards any authority including that in families thirtyfive years ago a bbc commentator insightfully worried that we are turning out adults who have an even less clear and consistent attitude towards authority than we have ourselves and who will be even less capable than their parents in raising children with a sane attitude towards authority and so an insidious avalanche may be developing gathering a ghastly momentum from generation to generation8 the ghastly momentum increases as profound social changes now occur in only a few years moro 912 unfortunately it is easier to praise the family than to create a successful family it is easier to talk as i am doing of family values than to implement those values it is easier to rejoice over our rich memories of a good family than to provide the rising generation with its own rich memories the hard doctrines however insist that we ask some hard questions how can a nation nurture family values without consistently valuing and protecting the family in its public policies how can we value the family without valuing parenting and how can we value parenting if we do not value marriage how can there be love at home without love in a marriage so many selfish tugs draw fathers and mothers away from each other and away from their children in contrast so much of the restoration focuses on fundamental principles pertaining to the family including sealings of eternal families latterday saints therefore have no choice but to stand up and to speak up whenever the institution of the family is concerned even if we are misunderstood resented or brushed aside after all mortal families predate the founding of nations and families will exist after the almighty hath made a full end of all nations dc 876 for latterday saints though it is to be done in the lords own way every year should be the year of the family however as latterday saints we need to do better in our familiesmuch better there should be less wringing of hands and more loving arms around our families of all the work of perfecting the saints none compares to that done in healthy families president david o mckay taught the home is the basis of a righteous life and no other instrumentality can take its place nor fulfill its essential functions9 sometimes unintentionally even certain extracurricular church activities insensitively administered can hamper family life instructively after the resurrected jesus taught the nephites he said go ye unto your homes and ponder upon the things which i have said and pray and prepare for the morrow 3 ne 173 jesus did not say go to your civic clubs town meetings or even stake centers attending to all family duties includes really teaching our children to understand the doctrine of repentance faith in christ the son of the living god dc 6825 what a different view of parenting from that of the world marie winn lamented in children without childhood how there is an emerging but unjustified tendency to treat children as if they have the capacity for unrestricted adult experience10 brothers and sisters we may not be able to change such trends but we can refuse to be a part of them when parents fail to transmit testimony and theology along with decency those families are only one generation from serious spiritual decline having lost their savor the law of the harvest is nowhere more in evidence and nowhere more relentless than in family gardens in addition to our having loving family sociality which one day will be coupled with eternal glory we stress again and again the available remedies of family prayers family home evenings and family scripture study dc 1302 moreover personal revelation regarding parenting can provide customized guidance and reassurance applying basic remedies will take some time and will not fix everything immediately what could be more basic however than love at home when annually in america there are four million reports of domestic violence rivaling the number of births in america11 violence in america now kills the equivalent of a classroomful of children every two days12 in the face of such challenges we need more mothers who know the truth whose children do not doubt their mothers know it see alma 5648 my children and grandchildren are blessed with such a mother and grandmother we need more kind and thoughtful fathers who also carry the authority of example more parents should be remembered as a prophets daughter helen lee goates remembers hers a father who was gentle beneath his firmness and a mother who was firm beneath her gentleness13 in the healthy family first and best we can learn to listen forgive praise and to rejoice in the achievements of others there also we can learn to tame our egos work repent and love in families with spiritual perspective yesterday need not hold tomorrow hostage if we sometimes act the fool loving families know this is not our last act the curtain is not rung down to some these remedies and things like them may seem too simple to heal a society stung by so many afflictions in afflicted ancient israel some also disdained the simple divinely provided remedies and they perished see 1 ne 1741 obviously family values mirror our personal priorities given the gravity of current conditions would parents be willing to give up just one outside thing giving that time and talent instead to the family parents and grandparents please scrutinize your schedules and priorities in order to ensure that lifes prime relationships get more prime time even consecrated and devoted brigham young was once told by the lord take especial care of your family dc 1263 sometimes it is the most conscientious who need this message the most society should focus anew on the headwatersthe familywhere values can be taught lived experienced and perpetuated otherwise brothers and sisters we will witness even more widespread flooding downstream featuring even more corruption and violence see gen 61112 matt 2437 if the combination of rainmakers prevails however the rains will continue to descend and the floods will continue to come dikes and sandbags downstream will be no match for the coming crests more and more families even nations if built upon secular sand instead of gospel granite will suffer as the number of dysfunctional families increases their failures will spill into already burdened schools and streets it is not a pretty scene even now nations in which traditional idealism gives way to modern cynicism will forfeit the blessings of heaven which they so urgently need and such nations will also lose legitimacy in the eyes of their citizens amid the babel of prescriptions from so many kinds of voices in the world rescuing and redeeming perspective requires our coming to know who jesus christ is how he lived and what he died for 1 cor 1410 see also john 1027 after all it is jesus who has given us commanding perspective concerning families therefore as this easter day draws to a close how fitting that we contemplate atoning jesusbending and curved in gethsemane his bleeding curvature transformed the grammar of death until gethsemane and calvary death was a punctuating rigid exclamation point then death too curvedinto a mere comma praise be to jesus for bearing the sins and pains of all the family of adam back then 2 ne 921 2 ne 220 let us strive here and now to take especial care of our families as jesus did of his even the family of all the earth 2 ne 220 i so pray in the name of jesus christ amen notes the story
