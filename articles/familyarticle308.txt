strength in the savior by chieko n okazaki first counselor in the relief society general presidency my dear sisters aloha what a joy it is to meet with you this evening and to feel connected to all of our sisters throughout the church in service just as the video shows with the support and direction of our priesthood leaders i am grateful for the guidance that comes to us from prophets apostles and other church leaders tonight i want to share with you some ideas about strengthening families if i were to ask you what the church teaches about strengthening families i know that you would say things like spend time together have family prayer hold family home evening and regular scripture study in addition to these important things i want to talk about building stronger families by building a stronger youstrong in your faith of the savior thats where strong families come fromfrom strong individuals president gordon b hinckley has said the strength of the church is not in its thousands of houses of worship across the world nor in its universities or seminaries and institutes these are all facilities desirable means to an end but only auxiliary to that which is the true strength the strength of this church lies in the hearts of its people in the individual testimony and conviction of the truth of this work1 all of us women have an image of the ideal familya marriage in the temple to an active priesthood holder and children who are obedient and faithful but president ezra taft benson has pointed out that only 14 percent of american households in 1980 match the traditional image of a familyworking husband fulltime mother with children still in the home2 reliable statistics indicate that only one out of five lds families in the united states have a husband and wife married in the temple with children in their home3 as elder m russell ballard has already reminded us there is great diversity in lds homes but all of these homes can be righteous homes where individuals love each other love the lord and strengthen each other let me give you an example here are two quilts both are handmade beautiful and delightful to snuggle down in or wrap around a grandchild now look at this quilt its a hawaiian quilt with a strong predictable pattern we can look at half of the quilt and predict what the other half looks like sometimes our lives seem patterned predictable in happy ways in order now look at this second quilt this style is called a crazy quilt some pieces are the same color but no two pieces are the same size theyre odd shapes they come together at odd angles this is an unpredictable quilt sometimes our lives are unpredictable unpatterned not neat or wellordered well theres not one right way to be a quilt as long as the pieces are stitched together firmly both of these quilts will keep us warm and cozy both are beautiful and made with love theres not just one right way to be a mormon woman either as long as we are firmly grounded in faith in the savior make and keep covenants live the commandments and work together in charity all of us face different family circumstances and home situations all of us need strength in dealing with them this strength comes from faith in the saviors love and in the power of his atonement if we trustingly put our hand in the saviors we can claim the promise of the sacramental prayer to always have his spirit with us all problems are manageable with that strength and all other problems are secondary in urgency to maintaining a strong spiritual life if we have faith we will desire to pray often and sincerely and his spirit will teach us what to pray for see rom 82627 we will have the sensitivity to serve compassionately we will have the wisdom that we need for our church callings we can build a loving and respectful partnership with our husbands children parents and friends if we always have christs spirit with us we will have a wise consultant when we are perplexed by our childrens needs we will receive help in making correct decisions and strength in carrying them out we will give and receive loyal friendship and feel in ourselves when the advice we receive from others is truly suited to our needs we will hold a clear vision of gospel ideals and aspire toward them even as we deal patiently with the limitations of reality through faith in the savior we can magnify our opportunities cope with our problems and keep both of them in perspective strong families build strong individuals who in turn strengthen other family members we take turns in lifting each other i have seen this process at work in my own life when my husband and i married i was a latterday saint and he was a congregationalist i was concerned about marrying a nonmember but we shared a strong faith in the savior and i felt that ed would continue to seek and accept truth ten months after our marriage he was baptized we were the only latterday saints in our families but we could strengthen each other when ed was ordained to the melchizedek priesthood the concept of priesthood was a thrilling and exciting one for each of us he was the first priesthood holder in the okazaki family and i of course had no relatives who were priesthood holders priesthood was something we talked about and worked to understand together how grateful i was for eds goodness and the many opportunities that the church gave him to bless others ed never took his priesthood for granted it was always a privilege to him one exercised with thanksgiving and humility supporting ed in his callings and feeling his support for me in mine were part of the partnership of our marriage in 1988 we were asked to an interview with the missionary committee we suspected that a calling might be in the offing so ed who had had a stroke about two years earlier that affected his heart went to the doctor first so that he would know if he could accept an assignment the doctor was absolutely firm that ed must not leave the country thus when ed was asked if he could accept an overseas assignment he was very disappointed to report the doctors instructions i would have supported ed wholeheartedly in his calling but it was not to be then a few weeks later i was called to serve on the primary general board and a year and a half later i was called to my present position in the relief society when i was being set apart president thomas s monson who had known us for years said eddie chieko has supported you in your priesthood callingsin the bishopric as mission president and as regional representative now its your turn to support her ed smiled and agreed to do so of course this was not a change for ed ed and i loved growing in the gospel as a family we were grateful we had the strength to care for our sons and grateful to see them grow up to become selfreliant people with the strength to help others we rejoiced in the strength that an intelligent and sensitive daughterinlaw brought to our family we delighted in seeing our grandsons born and begin to follow the cycle of family life themselves i never appreciated the strength of my sons more than last year when my husband was dying all three of us sustained each other and consulted with each other but i saw ken take the lead in working with the doctors and the hospital then when ed died bob took the lead in making funeral arrangements and dealing with the legal procedures that had to be followed in planning the funeral service i took the lead as each of us passed through different stages in our shock and grief we had the others for support when one of us needed to rise to an occasion we could when we needed to withdraw with our sorrow we could because one of the others could step forward and be the leader i have used the example of my own family because i have seen for myself that it is to our families that we first turn in such crises but whatever your family circumstances i believe the strength we need can always be there because it comes from the savior and his love sometimes our own faith enables us to draw on that love sometimes it is the faith and love of others that strengthen us we do not know the challenges and adversities that life will give us but the scriptures promise us that with god nothing shall be impossible luke 137 and we can say with the apostle paul i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me philip 413 the scriptures are filled with testimonies of the strength that comes from the savior i always feel a lift of the heart that comes to me when i read these rejoicings of the prophets moses exulted the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation ex 152 david sang god is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect 2 sam 2233 to isaiah the lord promised fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness isa 4110 how can we build this kind of faith in the strength of the savior david had counsel for the people of his time that i repeat to you seek the lord and his strength continually 1 chr 1611 blessed is the man or woman whose strength is in thee go from strength to strength ps 845 7 sisters strengthen yourselves by seeking the source of true strengththe savior come unto him he loves you he desires your happiness and exults in your desires for righteousness make him your strength your daily companion your rod and your staff let him comfort you there is no burden we need bear alone his grace compensates for our deficiencies your strength will strengthen othersyour children your husband your friends and your sisters in the gospel that strength will flow back from them to you when you need it through the years my circumstances have changed i was a single woman then the wife of a nonmember then a partner in a temple sealing a mother a motherinlaw and grandmother and now a widow i have known the saviors love in all of these circumstances my own faith has been rewarded as i have felt the saviors presence and power in my home my dear sisters our circumstances will not always be ideal but we can still strive to live up to them from the bottom of my heart and from more than fifty years of experience in the church i testify that the savior extends to us all the same mercy the same healing power and the same perfect love he has assured us that it is his work and glory to bring to pass our immortality and eternal life what joy it gives us to contemplate eternal life with our families as part of the great family of god
