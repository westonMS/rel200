the topic of temples we know that our time in the temple is crucial to our salvation and exaltation and to that of our families after we receive our own temple ordinances and make sacred covenants with god each one of us needs the ongoing spiritual strengthening and tutoring that is possible only in the house of the lord and our ancestors need us to serve as proxy for them consider the great mercy and fairness of god who before the foundation of the world provided a way to give temple blessings to those who died without a knowledge of the gospel these sacred temple rites are ancient to me that antiquity is thrilling and another evidence of their authenticity2 my dear brothers and sisters the assaults of the adversary are increasing exponentially in intensity and in variety3 our need to be in the temple on a regular basis has never been greater i plead with you to take a prayerful look at how you spend your time invest time in your future and in that of your family if you have reasonable access to a temple i urge you to find a way to make an appointment regularly with the lordto be in his holy housethen keep that appointment with exactness and joy i promise you that the lord will bring the miracles he knows you need as you make sacrifices to serve and worship in his temples currently we have 159 dedicated temples the proper care and maintenance of those temples is very important to us with the passage of time temples are inevitably in need of refreshing and renewal to that end plans are now being made to renovate and update the salt lake temple and other
