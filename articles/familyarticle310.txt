how will our children remember us by bishop robert d hales presiding bishop imagebishop robert d hales my message today is one of love i love my dear companion mary my two sons and their families may i express appreciation for all the joy they have brought into my life as i think about these relationships with my own family i cannot help but return to the example i received from my own parents our children will remember us by our example from my earliest childhood i remember experiences which taught me about the priesthood which i hold and to respect and love the relationship my father and mother had with one another my father taught me respect for the priesthood while serving in the aaronic priesthood we passed the sacrament using stainless steel sacrament trays which as a result of spilled water were often dulled with hard water spots as a holder of the aaronic priesthood i was responsible for helping to prepare the sacrament father asked me to bring home the trays and together we cleaned them with steel wool until every tray sparkled when i passed the sacrament i knew we had participated in making the sacrament ordinance a little more sacred on vacations father would take us to historical sites that were prominent in church history to build our knowledge and testimonies on one occasion when i was a twelveyearold deacon father asked if i would like to go to the baseball hall of fame in cooperstown new york and to the hill cumorah pageant near palmyra new york this is where joseph smith was led to the golden plates which were later translated into the book of mormon father also took me to the sacred grove where joseph smith had prayed to heavenly father and was visited in a vision by god the father and his son jesus christ we prayed together in the grove and expressed our desire to be true and faithful to the priesthood which we held father later painted a picture of the place where we had prayed and gave it to me as a reminder of our promises made that day together it hangs in my office today and serves as a reminder each day of my sacred experience and promises made with my earthly father as well as my heavenly father on another occasion father took me to the susquehanna river where in 1829 joseph smith and oliver cowdery received the aaronic priesthood from a visitation of john the baptist father explained that the restoration of the priesthood was one of the most significant events in this dispensation i learned respect for womanhood from my fathers tender caring for my mother my sister and his sisters father was the first to arise from dinner to clear the table my sister and i would wash and dry the dishes each night at fathers request if we were not there father and mother would clean the kitchen together in later years after mother had a stroke father faithfully cared for her every need the last two years of her life required 24hour care he being called by mother every few minutes day or night i shall never forget his example of loving care for his cherished companion he told me it was small payment for over fifty years of my mothers loving devotion to him father was a commercial artist for a large advertising agency in new york city on one occasion he was under tremendous stress to produce an advertising campaign he had come home on a friday evening and worked most of the night saturday morning after a few hours working in the yard he retired to his studio to create an advertising campaign for a new product my sister and i found great delight in chasing each other round and round the dining room table which was situated in a room directly over his head he had told us to please stop at least twice but to no avail this time he came bounding up the steps and collared me he sat me down and taught a great lesson he did not yell or strike me even though he was very annoyed he explained the creative process the spiritual process if you will and the need for quiet pondering and getting close to the spirit for his creativity to function because he took time to explain and help me understand i learned a lesson that has been put to use almost daily in my life my point in telling these stories is that we as parents have the privilege and the responsibility of teaching gospel principles by our example and testimony to our loved ones my father has been gone for seven years but i remember him with love and respect examples become memories that guide our lives memories of mother and her tiny slippered feet on top of fathers feet as they danced around the kitchen and their expressions of love for each other memories as a young boy sitting on the floor by mother and fathers bedside while they took turns reading aloud from the scriptures memories in later years of going to the salt lake temple and watching mother and father participate in the presentation of the endowment ceremony may the memories our children have guide their lives now i find myself asking the question how will my children remember me how will your children remember you the calling of father or mother is sacred and carries with it great significance one of the greatest privileges and responsibilities given to us is that of being a parenthelping to bring to earth a child of god and having the sacred responsibility to love care and guide children back to our heavenly father in many ways earthly parents represent their heavenly father in the process of nurturing loving caring and teaching children children naturally look to their parents to learn of the characteristics of their heavenly father after they come to love respect and have confidence in their earthly parents they often unknowingly develop the same feelings towards their heavenly father no parent on earth is perfect in fact children are very understanding when they sense and feel that parents truly care and are attempting to be the best they can be it helps children to see that good parents can have differing opinions and that these differences can be worked out without striking yelling or throwing things they need to see and feel calm communication with respect for each others viewpoints so they themselves will know how to work through differences in their own lives parents are counseled to teach their children by precept and example the lord has said inasmuch as parents have children in zion or in any of her stakes which are organized that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance faith in christ the son of the living god and of baptism and the gift of the holy ghost by the laying on of the hands when eight years old the sin be upon the heads of the parents and they shall also teach their children to pray and to walk uprightly before the lord dc 6825 28 children who are taught to pray and who pray with their parents when young are more likely to pray when they are older those who are taught when they are young to love god and believe he lives will more often continue their spiritual development and increase their feelings of love as they mature however a child even one raised with great love and care and carefully taught may choose when an adult not to follow those teachings for a variety of reasons how should we react we understand and respect the principle of agency we pray that lifes experiences will help them regain their desire and ability to live the gospel they are still our children and we will love and care about them always we do not lock the doors of our house nor the doors to our heart some people feel they cannot accept or fulfill a church calling if one of their children is straying as we accept the calling and do our best we may have a profound spiritual effect on those we love the most if we think other families dont have any difficulties or any problems we just dont know them well enough if the example we have received from our parents was not good it is our responsibility to break the cycle certainly parents will make mistakes in their parenting process but through humility faith prayer and study each person can learn a better way and in so doing bless the lives of family members now and teach correct traditions for the generations that follow the lords promises are sure i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go ps 328 and again whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name which is right believing that ye shall receive behold it shall be given unto you 3 ne 1820 selfishness is so frequently at the core of family relationship problems when individuals focus on their own selfish interests they miss opportunities to listen to understand or to consider the other persons feelings or needs president benson has cautioned us we must be more christlike in our attitude and behavior than what we see in the world we should be as charitable and considerate with our loved ones as christ is with us he is kind loving and patient with each of us should we not reciprocate the same love to our companions and children what manner of men ought we to be you remember the lords answer is this verily i say unto you even as i am 3 ne 2727 ensign nov 1983 p 44 president benson continues as i have listened to reports of unrighteous actions i have asked myself how can any member of the churchany man who holds the priesthood of godbe guilty of cruelty to his own wife and children such actions if practiced by a priesthood holder are almost inconceivable they are totally out of character with the teachings of the church and the gospel of jesus christ as priesthood holders we are to emulate the character of the savior ensign nov 1983 p 42 section 121 of the doctrine and covenants teaches us no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood only by persuasion by longsuffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned dc 12141 these qualities of kindness and pure knowledge are reflective of our heavenly father we get an insight into the love jesus had for his father our father in heaven in jesus intercessory prayer recorded in the bible seventeenth chapter of john the suffering and the atoning sacrifice were nigh at hand these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou has sent john 171 3 jesus acknowledged he was with his father before coming to earth and the love they had for each other he said o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world john 175 2324 it is touching to me that jesus closes his prayer with a desire that we might know and love our father as he does even though we cant remember him in our mortal estate jesus prayed o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i have known thee and these disciples have known that thou hast sent me john 1725 jesus was able to complete his mission of the atonement on earth because of the knowledge example and love of his father likewise may each of us as parents and especially as brethren in the priesthood through our example love and care be remembered by our children to have the qualities that our heavenly father and our savior have that we may endure to the end and some day return with our families to their celestial presence i pray in the name of jesus christ amen
