bring up a child in the way he should go by president gordon b hinckley first counselor in the first presidency imagepresident gordon b hinckley my brethren and sisters near and far i extend to each of you my love and gratitude i am deeply grateful for your sustaining faith and prayers we need your prayers we desire always to be worthy of them many of you write letters of encouragement and confidence these are deeply appreciated we likewise pray for you a few days ago there came to my office a man from las vegas nevada his wife and married daughter were with him when we had accomplished the purpose of his visit the younger woman asked if i would accept something from her thirteenyearold daughter she unwrapped a painting of two butterflies around a flowering shrub the mother explained that her daughter had been struck by a car in a terrible accident when she was four years of age her body was badly broken she was left paralyzed from the shoulders down a quadriplegic without the use of arms or legs she had painted this picture holding a brush between her teeth and moving her head as i listened to that story the painting grew in beauty and value before my eyes it became more than a portrayal of butterflies it represented remarkable courage in the face of blinding adversity tenacious practice in holding and moving the brush pleading prayers for help faiththe faith of a child nurtured by loving parents that she could create beauty notwithstanding her handicap some might say that this is not a masterpiece without knowledge of its origin that could be the judgment but what is the test of art is it not the inspiration which comes from looking at it i will hang this small painting in my study so that during occasional hours of struggle there will come into my mind the picture of a beautiful little girl robbed of the use of her feet and hands gripping the handle of a paintbrush in her teeth to create a thing of beauty thank you krystal for what you have done for me i hope the telling of your story will bring a new measure of strength to others who facing discouragement have felt they could not go on i hope that your example will be as a polar star to lead them in the darkness through which they stumble when i think of those who carry heavy burdens my mind goes to our beloved prophet president benson is now in his ninetyfifth year he still wears the mantle of his sacred office but his activities are seriously limited he is unable to be with us this morning or to speak to us we love him we honor him we pray for him we sustain him and we go forward this church is established on principles that are divine from the day of its organization it has been led by prophets and i solemnly testify that the lord jesus christ whose church it is and whose name it bears will never let any man or group of men lead it astray his is the power to remove them if they should ever be found taking the wrong turn we have critics both within and without although they are vocal and have access to the media they are relatively few in number if we were entirely without criticism we would be concerned our responsibility is not to please the world but rather to do the will of the lord and from the beginning the divine will so often has been contrary to the ways of the world these worldly ways appear to be on a course that should be of concern to every thoughtful man and woman we in america are saddled with a huge financial deficit in our national budget this has led to astronomical debt but there is another deficit which in its longterm implications is more serious it is a moral deficit a decline in values in the lives of the people which is sapping the very foundation of our society it is serious in this land and it is serious in every other nation of which i know some few months ago there appeared in the wall street journal what was spoken of as an index of what is happening to our culture i read from this statement since 1960 the us population has increased 41 the gross domestic product has nearly tripled and total social spending by all levels of government has experienced more than a fivefold increase but during the same period there has been a 560 increase in violent crime a 419 increase in illegitimate births a quadrupling in divorce rates a tripling of the percentage of children living in singleparent homes more than a 200 increase in the teenage suicide rate william j bennett quantifying americas decline wall street journal 15 mar 1993 the article concludes with a statement from alexander solzhenitsyn the west has been undergoing an erosion and an obscuring of high moral and ethical ideals the spiritual axis of life has grown dim one need not of course read statistics to recognize a moral decay that seems to be going on all about us it is evident in the easy breakup of marriages in widespread infidelity in the growth of youth gangs in the increased use of drugs and the epidemic spread of aids and in a growing disregard for the lives and property of others it is seen in the defacement of private and public property with graffiti which destroys beauty and is an insult to art it is expressed in the language of the gutter which is brought into our homes the endless sex and violence on network tv the trash of so many motion pictures the magnified sensuality found in much of modern literature the emphasis on sex education a widespread breakdown of law and orderall are manifestations of this decay what is the answer is there any way to change the course of the ethical and moral slide we are experiencing i believe there is what is happening is simply an ugly expression of the declining values of our society those who are concerned with the problem advocate more legal regulation large appropriations for increased police forces tax increases to build additional jails and prisons these may be needed to deal with the present problems they may help in the near term but they will be only as a bandage too small for the sore they may help in taking care of the fruits but they will not get at the roots in searching for remedies we speak of a greater work that must be done in our schools but educators have largely abdicated their responsibility for teaching values the church is looked tothis and all other churches i am grateful for what the pope recently said in denver in warning against moral pitfalls i am pleased to note that the baptists have begun a campaign for chastity we as a church are doing much very much and i think we are accomplishing much but it is not enough when all is said and done the primary place in building a value system is in the homes of the people i read the other day of a father who pleaded with a judge to lock up his son because he could not control him i do not doubt that he has tried but it is now too late attitudes have been fixed habits have become rigid if we are to turn this tide the effort must begin with children when they are young and pliable when they will listen and learn not long after we were married we built our first home we had very little money i did much of the work myself it would be called sweat equity today the landscaping was entirely my responsibility the first of many trees that i planted was a thornless honey locust envisioning the day when its filtered shade would assist in cooling the house in the summertime i put it in a place at the corner where the wind from the canyon to the east blew the hardest i dug a hole put in the bare root put soil around it poured on water and largely forgot it it was only a wisp of a tree perhaps threequarters of an inch in diameter it was so supple that i could bend it with ease in any direction i paid little attention to it as the years passed then one winter day when the tree was barren of leaves i chanced to look out the window at it i noticed that it was leaning to the west misshapen and out of balance i could scarcely believe it i went out and braced myself against it as if to push it upright but the trunk was now nearly a foot in diameter my strength was as nothing against it i took from my toolshed a block and tackle attaching one end to the tree and another to a wellset post i pulled the rope the pulleys moved a little and the trunk of the tree trembled slightly but that was all it seemed to say you cant straighten me its too late ive grown this way because of your neglect and i will not bend finally in desperation i took my saw and cut off the great heavy branch on the west side the saw left an ugly scar more than eight inches across i stepped back and surveyed what i had done i had cut off the major part of the tree leaving only one branch growing skyward more than half a century has passed since i planted that tree my daughter and her family live there now the other day i looked again at the tree it is large its shape is better it is a great asset to the home but how serious was the trauma of its youth and how brutal the treatment i used to straighten it when it was first planted a piece of string would have held it in place against the forces of the wind i could have and should have supplied that string with ever so little effort but i did not and it bent to the forces that came against it i have seen a similar thing many times in children whose lives i have observed the parents who brought them into the world seem almost to have abdicated their responsibility the results have been tragic a few simple anchors would have given them the strength to withstand the forces that have shaped their lives now it appears it is too late every individual in the world is a child of a mother and a father neither can ever escape the consequences of their parenthood inherent in the very act of creation is responsibility for the child who is created none can with impunity run from that responsibility it is not enough simply to provide food and shelter for the physical being there is an equal responsibility to provide nourishment and direction to the spirit and the mind and the heart wrote paul to timothy but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel 1 tim 58 i am satisfied that paul was speaking of more than physical nourishment many years ago president stephen l richards then a counselor in the first presidency speaking from this pulpit made an eloquent plea to put father back at the head of the family see conference report apr 1958 p 94 i repeat that plea to all fathers yours is the basic and inescapable responsibility to stand as the head of the family that does not carry with it any implication of dictatorship or unrighteous dominion it carries with it a mandate that fathers provide for the needs of their families those needs are more than food clothing and shelter those needs include righteous direction and the teaching by example as well as precept of basic principles of honesty integrity service respect for the rights of others and an understanding that we are accountable for that which we do in this life not only to one another but also to the god of heaven who is our eternal father let every mother realize that she has no greater blessing than the children which have come to her as a gift from the almighty that she has no greater mission than to rear them in light and truth in understanding and love that she will have no greater happiness than to see them grow into young men and women who respect principles of virtue who walk free from the stain of immorality and from the shame of delinquency said the writer of proverbs train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it prov 226 the health of any society the happiness of its people their prosperity and their peace all find their roots in the teaching of children by fathers and mothers the very structure of our society is now threatened by broken homes and the tragic consequences of those homes i believe that with effort we can change this course we must begin with parents we must provide understanding on the part of every man and woman of the eternal purposes of life of the obligations of marriage and of the responsibilities of parenthood to men who beget children and then abandon them i say that god will hold you accountable for these are also his children whose cries over what you have done reach up to him with the obligation to beget goes the responsibility to nurture to protect to teach to guide in righteousness and truth yours is the power and the responsibility to preside in a home where there is peace and security love and harmony i remind mothers everywhere of the sanctity of your calling no other can adequately take your place no responsibility is greater no obligation more binding than that you rear in love and peace and integrity those whom you have brought into the world to both of you let no bickering cloud the spirit of your home set aside your selfishness in the interest of a far greater and eternal cause bring up your children in light and truth as the lord has commanded could you wish for anything more than peace for your children could you benefit society in any better way i make you a solemn and sacred promise that if you will do this the time will come when looking upon those you have created nurtured and loved you will see the fruits of your nurturing and get on your knees and thank the lord for his blessing to you now with all of this i know there are very many of you who are wonderful parents and whose children are growing in righteousness happy and productive will be their lives and the world will be the better for them i thank you and most warmly congratulate you surely you are fortunate but there are otherstoo many among our ownwhose children to quote the revelation are growing up in wickedness and who seek not the riches of eternity but their eyes are full of greediness dc 6831 to these i make my appeal it may not be easy it may be fraught with disappointment and challenge it will require courage and patience i remind you of the faith and determination of the thirteenyearold girl who holding a paintbrush in her teeth created the painting i showed you earlier love can make the differencelove generously given in childhood and reaching through the awkward years of youth it will do what money lavished on children will never do and patience with a bridling of the tongue and selfmastery over anger the writer of proverbs declared a soft answer turneth away wrath prov 151 and encouragement that is quick to compliment and slow to criticize these with prayers will accomplish wonders you cannot expect to do it alone you need heavens help in rearing heavens childyour child who is also the child of his or her heavenly father o god our eternal father bless the parents to teach with love and patience and encouragement those who are most precious the children who have come from thee that together they might be safeguarded and directed for good and in the process of growth bring blessings to the world of which they will be a part i pray in the name of jesus christ amen
