look up and press on by elaine l jack relief society general president imageelaine l jack when my four sons were all at home my husband joe and i spent many summer days hiking with them our favorite places to hike were in the high mountains we all loved the challenge of a tough climb up and then that exhilarating moment of standing at what seemed to be the top of the world we would carefully scan the horizon relishing the sight of other peaks and valleys one of the best adventures of my life was the day we climbed three adjacent mountain passes beginning early in the morning we began our ascent moving ever higher the hike proved long and demanding yet each view held its own majesty and perspective my satisfaction at what i saw far exceeded any weariness i felt i have never forgotten the awe and accomplishment i experienced when i stood at the top of a mountain and looked out on this wide and wonderful world today my beloved relief society sisters we join hands around the world while we stand on another type of peak from this pinnacle of 150 years of relief society we survey the rich fruits of charity sown from seeds of faith in 135 countries and territories how satisfying it is to see testimonies built individuals blessed charity developed and exercised families strengthened and sisterhood enjoyed by over three million relief society members your vantage point may actually be a mountaintop it may be the knoll of a grassy plain or a mound of sand in the desert it could be a favorite stretch of beach or the icy crest of a snowpacked hill it may be the top step of your own front porch whatever your perspective today i ask you to stand arm in arm with me and look up let us climb together to new spiritual heights we will echo isaiahs words let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths isa 23 today i ask you to undertake with me a spiritual journey worthy of our best efforts i ask you to press forward with me in the quest for unparalleled levels of personal spirituality let us seek keener vision and stronger hearts let us make charity never faileth a motto of such personal significance that the whole world will be blessed by us the daughters of god who are the sisters of relief society with this broadcast we join as we never have before never in the history of the church have the women of zion been linked so closely together this is symbolic reminding us that we come together in the greatest of all causes the gospel of jesus christ as a young girl growing up in the foothills of the canadian rockies i often imagined climbing the distant peaks i could see today as we are literally linked together across the continents of the world we ascend mountains far greater than those i saw sisters we are the covenant people blessed to live on the earth when we can prepare in earnest for the second coming of our savior i pray that we will daily rejoice in being alive now when we can covenant through baptism and in the house of the lord i feel as nephi expressed my soul delighteth in the covenants of the lord yea my soul delighteth in his grace and in his justice and power and mercy in the great and eternal plan of deliverance from death 2 ne 115 to be a woman of covenant is a sacred and holy calling our covenants should ennoble us serving as inspiration and incentive a deepened understanding of our covenants lifts our vision to the loftier vistas awaiting us as we are true followers of jesus christ we can become the daughters of god that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is moro 748 in this quest for the best in us we are like sariah who with lehi and their family left jerusalem at the lords command we stand with our family and provisions 1 ne 24 and we travel through the wilderness we give thanks unto the lord our god 1 ne 27 sometimes we grieve because of the hardened hearts of those we love some moments we are filled with joy and exceedingly glad 1 ne 51 at other times we exhort with all the feeling of a tender parent 1 ne 837 whether we are physical mothers or not we toil we encounter conflicts we strive for faith we suffer all things 1 ne 1720 yet like sariah we keep moving towards exaltation the ultimate promised land you recall that during the journey of lehi and sariahs family nephi broke his bow he was directed to go forth up into the top of the mountain 1 ne 1630 to obtain food for his family i wonder when he reached the top if he paused as i often have at such a height to look around and see how far he and his family had come and the direction in which they still needed to go beloved sisters from my vantage point i see your goodness and potential i know your lives have their difficulties i also see how far youve climbed already and what dazzling heights youve attained i feel the love of the savior for you and your love for him our lord himself promised i will go before your face i will be on your right hand and on your left and my spirit shall be in your hearts and mine angels round about you to bear you up dc 8488 with such a promise we can keep going with this assurance we will rise to spiritual heights previously unimagined a ward relief society president recently shared with me the reaction of a community worker to her request to inform the sisters of local service needs the president calmly explained that each relief society unit around the church would be undertaking a project the worker said you mean 18000 groups of relief society women are going to do something in their local communities then youll change the world we will change the world for the better for this journey to great heights is not any ordinary journey any more than was sariahs ours is a quest to change ourselves to become even truer disciples of our lord and savior we will lift our eyes to the mountains and move ceaselessly towards exaltation and how shall we scale this mountain one faithful step at a time i have a good friend with whom i have often counseled over the years about some of my gravest concerns particularly when i begin a new task and feel unsure she invariably says enthusiastically how exciting elaine you can do this i have been grateful for her confidence sisters i say today we can do this we will build the kingdom of godone person and one home at a time married single older younger mothering or childless we are going to prove that eliza r snow an early and inspired relief society leader was right there is no sister so isolated

homes with faith whether we live alone or with a house full of family for many of us the most rugged mountains we tackle are within the walls of our homes since we strive to become eternal family units we should prize our families dear sisters stay close to your husband your children your parents your brothers and sisters and those who feel like family because your lives have joined consider them your fellow voyagers a woman of mighty faith joined the church and because of pressing economic circumstances left her family and homeland her journey took her far but her faith took her farther when she was well into her retirement years she was called to be the ward relief society president that calling brought forth a lifetime of knowledge and skill she was a woman of such loving faith that the sisters of her relief society were drawn together as she put her arms around them physically and spiritually a young mother asked her how she developed such radiant faith this sister replied turn your back on the problems and look for the light sisters as we climb the mountains especially those in our own backyards let us look to the lord who is the light show that light to your family and those who feel like family for the brush at our feet will snag us and obstacles will surely bruise us but warm and steady the light beckons us on follow it knowing the challenges are real but so is the lord light a torch of faith at home and keep it burning brilliantly even when the night is long and the journey difficult we shall scale our spiritual peaks with courage courage is a powerful tool with it we can dig into the bedrock and stand steady even when the footing is treacherous i see so much of courage in you you walk miles to church you rebuild a home ruined by floods you go to school sometimes with your desk on your head you stretch limited money so you can feed your family you face death survive drought and forgive after a divorce you repent when thats what is needed you let go of old habits and espouse the gospel instead you pay tithing when your children need shoes you live through winter without warm clothes you raise children alone you accept a church calling when you have no idea how to do it you work to feel good about yourself even as you feel so imperfect you reach out to someone who may not extend a hand to you you patch up a longstanding family argument you put your family first even when other options entice you cultivate courage for it will help you live confidently and well the prophet moses told the children of israel who were ready to enter a new territory of many unknowns be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid for the lord thy god he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee deut 316 sisters the lord will not fail or forsake us we will climb our spiritual mountains rejoicing our hearts will resonate to isaiahs words for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands isa 5512 each insight each spiritual view should fill us with a spirit of thanksgiving that spills over into the lives of those around us we sisters in zion have the best reasons to thank the lord thank the lord for your testimony thank him for being alive now when your challenges come thank
