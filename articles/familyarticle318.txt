the family of the prophet joseph smith by elder m russell ballard of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder m russell ballard a relatively simple but significant event took place in nauvoo illinois on the fourth of august this year after many months of careful planning the descendants of joseph smith sr and lucy mack smith dedicated the refurbished smith family cemetery and opened it to the public as i attended the dedicatory services my thoughts were centered on the remarkable contribution the family of joseph smith sr and lucy mack smith made toward the restoration of the fulness of the gospel of jesus christ i was thinking especially of the prophet his brother hyrum and their parents i believe the smith family burial plot should have a special meaning to every member of the church we all want those who are interred there to rise up on resurrection day in a beautiful garden spot the prophet said in a funeral sermon i will tell you what i want if tomorrow i shall be called to lie in yonder tomb in the morning of the resurrection let me strike hands with my father and cry my father and he will say my son my son as soon as the rock rends and before we come out of our graves and when the voice calls for the dead to arise suppose i am laid by the side of my father what would be the first joy of my heart to meet my father my mother my brother my sister and when they are by my side i embrace them and they me history of the church 536162 each person who has a testimony of the gospel of jesus christ should love and appreciate joseph smith jr for he is the prophet and seer of the lord who has done more save jesus only for the salvation of men in this world than any other man that ever lived in it dc 1353 the ancient prophet nephi wrote that he was born of goodly parents 1 ne 11 so was the prophet joseph smith he once declared words and language are inadequate to express the gratitude that i owe to god for having given me so honorable a parentage history of the church 5126 the lord foreordained his father joseph smith sr who is spoken of in the holy scriptures to be one of the earthly parents of the prophet joseph of egypt prophesied that the latterday seer whom god would raise up to do his work would be called joseph jst gen 5033 and his name would be after the name of his father 2 ne 315 the heavenly messenger moroni admonished young joseph to go to his father following a glorious night of sacred instruction in josephs words this messenger commanded me to go to my father and tell him of the vision and commandments which i had received i obeyed i returned to my father in the field and rehearsed the whole matter to him he replied to me that it was of god and told me to go and do as commanded by the messenger jsh 14950 joseph smith sr was in tune with the spirit of the lord he knew that his young son spoke the truth he not only believed the boys words but encouraged him in the work he had been called to do joseph sr endured ridicule and persecution because of his prophet sons experiences and claims yet he was unwavering in his loving support and defended his son he saw and handled the plates of gold from which the book of mormon was translated and testified throughout his life to the truthfulness of that sacred book his name remains firmly affixed with those of the other witnesses to the book of mormon in the front pages of that second witness of jesus christ on one occasion he was imprisoned and told he would be released if he would deny the book of mormon not only did he not deny it but he converted two persons during his thirtyday confinement president lorenzo snow said i do not know that any man among the saints was more loved than father smith and when any one was seriously sick father smith would be called for whether it was night or day he was as noble and generous a man as i have ever known quoted in leroi c snow how lorenzo snow found god improvement era feb 1937 p 84 at the time of his death joseph smith sr was described as a man faithful to his god and to the church in every situation and under all circumstances through which he was called to pass history of the church 4192 just a few months following his passing from this life the lord revealed that joseph smith sr was in his presence and blessed and holy is he for he is mine dc 12419 indeed joseph smith sr played a vital role in establishing the kingdom of god upon the earth perhaps less visible than the prophets father but equally important in shaping and influencing his life was his mother lucy mack smith although this strong woman gave occasional leadership her primary role appeared to be support to the family she gave birth to eleven children and endured faithfully as all but four preceded her in death during her life she watched six of her immediate family and one grandson die as a result of ruthless mob violence and persecution lucy prepared herself early in her marriage to raise a prophet on one occasion she became seriously ill and the doctors said she would die lucy records that she made a solemn covenant with god that if he would let me live i would endeavor to serve him according to the best of my abilities after a voice assured her that she would live she told her mother the lord will let me live if i am faithful to the promise which i made to him to be a comfort to my mother my husband and my children lucy mack smith history of joseph smith by his mother lucy mack smith ed preston nibley salt lake city bookcraft 1979 pp 34 she gave continual encouragement support and strength to her son joseph the prophet his mother was the first person with whom young joseph shared some of his momentous experiences of the sacred grove years later he shared with her the joy and relief he felt when the lord allowed others to view the sacred plates of gold lucy wrote that joseph threw himself down beside me and exclaimed you do not know how happy i am the lord has now caused the plates to be shown to three more besides myself they have seen an angel and they will have to bear witness to the truth of what i have said for now they know for themselves that i do not go about to deceive the people and i feel as if i was relieved of a burden which was almost too heavy for me to bear lucy mack smith history p 152 the prophets mother shared also in his sorrows sufferings and persecutions one time a mob took joseph and his brother hyrum prisoner and threatened to shoot them the two brothers were confined under a cloth cover in a wagon their courageous mother risked her life and forced her way through the hostile mob to comfort her sons joseph and hyrum could not see their mother and could only extend a hand from under the confining cover as lucys hand and the hands of her sons touched the wagon drove off literally tearing the sorrowing mother from her two sons her determination to testify to the restoration of the gospel may have led her to dictate her wellknown history of joseph smith this was a major undertaking in her day the books importance to the church today is immeasurable it contains many details of the prophet josephs life that might never have been known otherwise it stands as a monument to the devotion of lucy mack smith and her family like great parents of all ages lucy turned to prayer for divine help to sustain her family during the march from ohio to missouri known as zions camp joseph and hyrum were seriously ill with cholera and their lives were almost taken at one point hyrum sprang to his feet and exclaimed joseph we shall return to our families i have had an open vision in which i saw mother kneeling under an apple tree and she is even now asking god in tears to spare our lives the spirit testifies that her prayers will be answered lucy mack smith history p 229 in the exercise of agency and in the divine providence of god lucys sons joseph and hyrum ultimately sealed their testimonies with their blood as the grieving mother looked upon their lifeless remains she cried my god my god why hast thou forsaken this family as a kind blessing to a faithful mother the lord softened her grief and granted to her the peace that only god can bestow a voice spoke to her soul i have taken them to myself that they might have rest lucy mack smith history p 324 hyrum smith older brother friend and mentor to the prophet showed absolute unequivocal love loyalty and allegiance to the lord and to his younger brother joseph their brotherhood may be unsurpassed the scriptures tell us in life they were not divided and in death they were not separated dc 1353 of hyrum joseph said i could pray in my heart that all my brethren were like unto my beloved brother hyrum who possesses the mildness of a lamb and the integrity of a job and in short the meekness and humility of christ and i love him with that love that is stronger than death for i never had occasion to rebuke him nor he me history of the church 2338 throughout hyrums life he guarded his younger brother as tenderly as if the prophet had been his own son joseph surely knew the value of true and faithful associates because he had trusted many who later proved to be false in addition to josephs tribute the lord spoke of his love for hyrum blessed is my servant hyrum smith for i the lord love him because of the integrity of his heart and because he loveth that which is right before me saith the lord dc 12415 hyrum was unwavering even in the face of death following one period of great deprivation and persecution he wrote i thank god that i felt a determination to die rather than deny the things which my eyes had seen which my hands had handled the plates from which the book of mormon was translated and which i had borne testimony to wherever my lot had been cast and i can assure my beloved brethren that i was enabled to bear as strong a testimony when nothing but death presented itself as ever i did in my life times and seasons dec 1839 p 23 from the prophet joseph and hyrum we can learn many valuable lessons i share just these two examples today in a letter dated march 15 1844 just a few months before his martyrdom hyrum wrote now therefore i say unto you you must cease preaching your miraculous things and let the mysteries alone until by and bye sic preach faith in the lord jesus christ repentance and baptism for the remission of sins the laying on of the hands for the gift of the holy ghost teaching the necessity of strict obedience unto these principles reasoning out of the scriptures proving them unto the people cease your schisms and divisions and your contentions humble yourselves times and seasons 15 mar 1844 p 474 and then from the prophet joseph there are those who profess to be saints who are too apt to murmur and find fault when any advice is given which comes in opposition to their feelings even when they themselves ask for counsel much more so when counsel is given unasked for which does not agree with their notion of things but brethren we hope for better things from the most of you we trust that you desire counsel from time to time and that you will cheerfully conform to it whenever you receive it from a proper source history of the church 445 these inspired statements from hyrum and joseph to church members in their day are certainly appropriate for church members today while standing in nauvoo at the foot of the headstone of these noble men i had the impression that they would have me counsel all members of the church to remain anchored to the basic and simple principles of the gospel study the scriptures look to the leaders of the church for guidance in these troubled times brothers and sisters be careful of the schisms divisions and contentions that are among us today keep the commandments so the holy ghost will be with you in your search for truth and knowledge i bear humble witness that joseph smith is one of the great noble ones to come to the earth he and his brother hyrum deserve our honor respect and gratitude as do other members of their family who assisted with the restoration of the fulness of the gospel i testify that president ezra taft benson is the prophet of god at this time and the apostles and other general authorities who are seated on this stand are ordained of god to preside over the church jesus our lord and savior stands at the head of the church our heavenly father lives and watches over each of his children to this i humbly testify in the name of jesus christ amen
