the powers of the priesthood by president dallin h oaks first counselor in the first presidency imagepresident dallin h oaks the magnifying of the holy priesthood you hold is vital to the work of the lord in your families and in your church callings my beloved brethren we have heard a revelatory announcement from president russell m nelson we have heard important elaborations by elders christofferson and rasband and by president eyring what will yet be said including more from president nelson will elaborate what you the lords leaders and priesthood holders will now do in your responsibilities to help with that i will review some fundamental principles governing the priesthood you hold i the priesthood the melchizedek priesthood is the divine authority god has delegated to accomplish his work to bring to pass the eternal life of man moses 139 in 1829 it was conferred upon joseph smith and oliver cowdery by the saviors apostles peter james and john see dc 2712 it is sacred and powerful beyond our powers to describe the keys of the priesthood are the powers to direct the exercise of priesthood authority thus when the apostles conferred the melchizedek priesthood upon joseph and oliver they also gave them the keys to direct its exercise see dc 271213 but not all priesthood keys were conferred at that time the entire keys and knowledge necessary for this dispensation of the fulness of times dc 12818 are given line upon line verse 21 additional keys were given in the kirtland temple seven years later see dc 1101116 these keys were given to direct priesthood authority in the additional assignments being given at that time such as baptism for the dead the melchizedek priesthood is not a status or a label it is a divine power held in trust to use for the benefit of gods work for his children we should always remember that men who hold the priesthood are not the priesthood it is not appropriate to refer to the priesthood and the women we should refer to the holders of the priesthood and the women ii a ministry of service now let us consider what the lord jesus christ expects from those who hold his priesthoodhow we are to bring souls unto him president joseph f smith taught it has truly been said that the church is perfectly organized the only trouble is that these organizations are not fully alive to the obligations that rest upon them when they become thoroughly awakened to the requirements made of them they will fulfil their duties more faithfully and the work of the lord will be all the stronger and more powerful and influential in the world1 president smith also cautioned the godgiven titles of honor associated with the several offices in and orders of the holy priesthood are not to be used nor considered as are the titles originated by man they are not for adornment nor are they expressive of mastership but rather of appointment to humble service in the work of the one master whom we profess to serve we are laboring for the salvation of souls and we should feel that this is the greatest duty devolving upon us therefore we should feel willing to sacrifice everything if need be for the love of god the salvation of men and the triumph of the kingdom of god upon the earth2 iii the offices of the priesthood in the lords church the offices in the melchizedek priesthood have different functions the doctrine and covenants refers to high priests as standing presidents or servants over different stakes scattered abroad dc 124134 it refers to elders as standing ministers to the lords church dc 124137 here are other teachings on these separate functions a high priest officiates and administers in spiritual things see dc 10710 12 also as president joseph f smith taught inasmuch as he has been ordained a high priest he should feel that he is obliged to set an example before the old and young worthy of emulation and to place himself in a position to be a teacher of righteousness not only by precept but more particularly by examplegiving to the younger ones the benefit of the experience of age and thus becoming individually a power in the midst of the community in which he dwells3 on the duties of an elder elder bruce r mcconkie of the quorum of the twelve taught an elder is a minister of the lord jesus christ he is commissioned to stand in the place and stead of his master in ministering to his fellowmen he is the lords agent4 elder mcconkie criticized the idea that one is only an elder every elder in the church holds as much priesthood as the president of the church he said what is an elder he is a shepherd a shepherd serving in the sheepfold of the good shepherd5 in this important function to minister in the sheepfold of the good shepherd there is no distinction between the offices of high priest and elder in the melchizedek priesthood in the great section 107 of the doctrine and covenants the lord declares high priests after the order of the melchizedek priesthood have a right to officiate in their own standing under the direction of the presidency in administering spiritual things and also in the office of an elder or offices in the aaronic priesthood dc 10710 see also verse 12 the most important principle for all priesthood holders is the principle taught by the book of mormon prophet jacob after he and his brother joseph were consecrated priests and teachers of the people he declared and we did magnify our office unto the lord taking upon us the responsibility answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not teach them the word of god with all diligence jacob 119 brethren our responsibilities as holders of the priesthood are serious matters other organizations can be satisfied with worldly standards of performance in delivering their messages and performing their other functions but we who hold the priesthood of god have the divine power that even governs entrance into the celestial kingdom of god we have the purpose and the responsibility the lord defined in the revealed preface to the doctrine and covenants we are to proclaim to the world that every man might speak in the name of god the lord even the savior of the world that faith also might increase in the earth that mine everlasting covenant might be established that the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world dc 12023 to fulfill this divine charge we must be faithful in magnifying our priesthood callings and responsibilities see dc 8433 president harold b lee explained what it means to magnify the priesthood when one becomes a holder of the priesthood he becomes an agent of the lord he should think of his calling as though he were on the lords errand that is what it means to magnify the priesthood6 therefore brethren if the lord himself were to ask you to help one of his sons or daughterswhich he has done through his servantswould you do it and if you did would you act as his agent on the lords errand relying on his promised help president lee had another teaching about magnifying the priesthood when you hold a magnifying glass over something it makes that thing look bigger than you could see it with the naked eye thats a magnifying glass now if anybody magnifies their priesthoodthat is makes it bigger than they first thought it was and more important than anyone else thought it wasthat is the way you magnify your priesthood7 here is an example of a priesthood holder magnifying his priesthood responsibility i heard this from elder jeffrey d erekson my companion in a stake conference in idaho as a young married elder desperately poor and feeling unable to finish his last year of college jeffrey decided to drop out and accept an attractive job offer a few days later his elders quorum president came to his home do you understand the significance of the priesthood keys i hold the elders quorum president asked when jeffrey said he did the president told him that since hearing of his intention to drop out of college the lord had tormented him during sleepless nights to give jeffrey this message as your elders quorum president i counsel you not to drop out of college that is a message to you from the lord jeffrey stayed in school years later i met him when he was a successful businessman and heard him tell an audience of priesthood holders that counsel has made all the difference in my life a priesthood holder magnified his priesthood and calling and that made all the difference in the life of another child of god iv priesthood in the family up to now i have been speaking of the functions of the priesthood in the church now i will speak of priesthood in the family i begin with keys the principle that priesthood authority can be exercised only under the direction of the one who holds the keys for that function is fundamental in the church but does not apply to the exercise of priesthood authority in the family8 a father who holds the priesthood presides in his family by the authority of the priesthood he holds he has no need to have the direction or approval of priesthood keys in order to counsel the members of his family hold family meetings give priesthood blessings to his wife and children or give healing blessings to family members or others imagefamily studying together if fathers would magnify their priesthood in their own family it would further the mission of the church as much as anything else they might do fathers who hold the melchizedek priesthood should keep the commandments so they will have the power of the priesthood to give blessings to their family members fathers should also cultivate loving family relationships so that family members will want to ask their fathers for blessings and parents should encourage more priesthood blessings in the family imagepriesthood blessing fathers function as equal partners of your wives as the family proclamation teaches9 and fathers when you are privileged to exercise the power and influence of your priesthood authority do so by persuasion by longsuffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned dc 12141 that high standard for the exercise of priesthood authority is most important in the family president harold b lee gave this promise just after he became president of the church never is the power of the priesthood which you hold more wonderful than when there is a crisis in your home a serious illness or some great decision that has to be made vested in the power of the priesthood which is the power of almighty god is the power to perform miracles if the lord wills it so but in order for us to use that priesthood we must be worthy to exercise it a failure to understand this principle is a failure to receive the blessings of holding that great priesthood10 my beloved brethren the magnifying of the holy priesthood you hold is vital to the work of the lord in your families and in your church callings i testify of him whose priesthood it is through his atoning suffering and sacrifice and resurrection all men and women have the assurance of immortality and the opportunity for eternal life each of us should be faithful and diligent in doing our part in this great work of god our eternal father in the name of jesus christ amen notes teachings of presidents of the church joseph f smith 1998 343 teachings
