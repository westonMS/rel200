fruits of the restored gospel of jesus christ by elder joseph b wirthlin of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder joseph b wirthlin my brethren and sisters im sure that all of us have been honored to be in the presence of president ezra taft benson the president of the church our prophet ive loved him and respected him all of my life as im sure you have throughout the ages the lord has referred to his people those who love him and keep his commandments in words that set them apart he has called them a peculiar treasure ex 195 a special people deut 76 a royal priesthood an holy nation 1 pet 29 scriptures refer to such people as saints as the savior taught by their fruits ye shall know them matt 720 in sharp contrast to those who live by gospel principles i see accounts of people who either ignore or dont understand these principles some do not live the gospel standards and live in sin evil dishonesty and crime the result is untold misery pain suffering and sorrow i am reminded of the saviors teachings when he declared therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it matt 72427 this analogy teaches us an important lesson we cannot have the fruits of the gospel without its roots through revelation the lord has established those rootsdistinctive principles of the fulness of the gospel they give us direction the lord has taught us how we should build our lives on a solid foundation like a rock that will withstand the temptations and storms of life may i give you some of the major principles of the gospel the godhead one distinctive principle is a true concept of the nature of the godhead we believe in god the eternal father and in his son jesus christ and in the holy ghost a of f 11 the godhead consists of three separate distinct personages who are one in purpose the father and the son have tangible bodies of flesh and bone while the holy ghost is a personage of spirit god truly is our father the father of the spirits of all mankind we are his literal offspring and are formed in his image we have inherited divine characteristics from him knowing our relationship to our heavenly father helps us understand the divine nature that is in us and our potential the doctrine of the fatherhood of god lays a solid foundation for selfesteem the hymn titled i am a child of god hymns 1985 no 301 states this doctrine in simple terms can a person who understands his divine parenthood lack selfesteem i have known people who have a deep abiding assurance of this truth and others who understand it only superficially and intellectually the contrast in their attitudes and the practical effect of these attitudes in their lives is remarkably apparent knowing that jesus christ is the firstborn son of god in the spirit and the only begotten son in the flesh gives a far more noble and majestic view of him than if he were just a great teacher or philosopher he is our lord the redeemer of all mankind our mediator with the father because of his love for us he has atoned for the sins of the world and has provided a way for the faithful to return to our heavenly fathers presence he is the greatest being to be born on this earththe perfect example he is lord of lords king of kings the creator the savior the god of the whole earth his name is the only name under heaven by which we can be saved he will come again in power and glory to dwell on the earth and will stand as judge of all mankind at the last day bible dictionary sv christ he stands as the head of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints we should be everlastingly grateful to him we should love him with all our hearts and should follow his example the holy ghost the third member of the godhead is a revelator see history of the church 658 he reveals the word of god he provides the convincing witness that the gospel is true and gives a person a testimony of the divinity of jesus christ he guides us in our choices and in our search for truth resurrection next i turn to our assurance of a literal resurrection the uniting after mortal death of the spirit with a body of flesh and bone jesus the first on this earth to be resurrected made the resurrection a certainty for all mankind this reality is a center point of hope in the gospel of jesus christ see 1 cor 151922 i have seen the contrast between those who have spiritual confidence in the resurrection and others who are confused and uncertain about our postmortal condition i was inspired by one mother who faced the untimely death of a twoyearold daughter with serenity despite her deep sorrow she attributed the peace she felt to her faith in a merciful god and in life everlasting she was confident that this sweet child was encompassed in the arms of gods love and that she and her daughter would be together again parenting in the lords plan parents are to teach their children during the impressionable and formative years when they develop attitudes and habits that last a lifetime president brigham young wisely recognized that the time of youth and early manhood is the proper time to gain mastery over bodily appetites and passions he warned that the man who suffers his passions to lead him becomes a slave to them and such a man will find the work of emancipation an exceedingly difficult one letters of brigham young to his sons ed dean c jessee salt lake city deseret book co 1974 p 130 we can be so grateful for principles that provide positive spiritual reinforcement for parental teachings and that direct young people away from the pitfalls that satan has strewn along the path of adolescence and young adulthood word of wisdom the word of wisdom was revealed to the prophet joseph smith in 1833 this revelation has been scrutinized and ignored attacked and defended ridiculed and praised meanwhile faithful saints have observed it as a token of their obedience to god for many years they could obey it only on faith in much the same spirit that adam offered sacrifice an angel asked him why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the lord and adam said unto him i know not save the lord commanded me moses 56 early members of the church obeyed the lords counsel without the benefit of present medical knowledge which has validated the physical benefits of their obedience we now know by scientific evidence what the saints have known by revelation for 158 years imagine the results we would see if the total populace were to live this law of health and never abuse their bodies with alcoholic beverages tobacco and other harmful substances what magnitude of decline would we see in automobile accidents illness and premature death fetal defects crime squandered dollars broken homes and wasted lives resulting from alcohol and other addictive drugs how much would lung cancer heart disease and other ailments caused by cigarette smoking decrease the fruits of this commandment bring innumerable blessings members of the church have obviously been blessed with health and spirituality by being obedient to this commandment welfare principles a sure indicator of true religion is a concern for the poor of the earth this leads us to provide for their needs by acts of charity i quote james pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep unspotted from the world james 127 stated simply charity means subordinating our interests and needs to those of others as the savior has done for all of us the apostle paul wrote that of faith hope and charity the greatest of these is charity 1 cor 1313 and moroni wrote that except ye have charity ye can in nowise be saved in the kingdom of god moro 1021 i believe that selfless service is a distinctive part of the gospel as president spencer w kimball said welfare service is not a program but the essence of the gospel it is the gospel in action it is the crowning principle of a christian life ensign nov 1977 p 77 the church does substantial but perhaps littleknown humanitarian work in many places in the world our ability to reach out to others is made possible only to the extent that we are selfreliant when we are selfreliant we will use material blessings we receive from god to take care of ourselves and our families and be in a position to help others comment on the principle of selfreliance may seem merely to echo the obvious but it runs counter to the trends in our society that shift responsibility to others many saints have been spared suffering because they have lived by this principle the foundation of selfreliance is hard work parents should teach their children that work is the prerequisite to achievement and success in every worthwhile endeavor children of legal age should secure productive employment and begin to move away from dependence on parents none of us should expect others to provide for us that which we can provide for ourselves missionary work missionary work was a distinct part of the saviors mortal ministry this is also true today the savior commanded go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature mark 1615 his disciples especially paul proclaimed the gospel message widely in the years following the saviors crucifixion in 1831 the lord revealed through the prophet joseph smith the voice of the lord is unto all men and there is none to escape and there is no eye that shall not see neither ear that shall not hear neither heart that shall not be penetrated dc 12 today more than 44000 missionaries are working to fulfill the divine mandate to preach the gospel they bless the people they teach by acquainting them with the fulness of the restored gospel they bless themselves by the dramatic growth and maturity that come during a mission every worthy young man should go on a mission also worthy young women and couples of the church can give invaluable service in the mission field they all serve as the emissaries of the lord we thank them most sincerely chastity another distinctive characteristic of the gospel is the adherence to the lords law of chastity from ancient times to the present the lord has commanded his people to obey this law such strict morality may seem peculiar or outdated in our day when the media portrays pornography and immorality as being normal and fully acceptable remember the lord has never revoked the law of chastity temple marriage vows increase the depth of faithfulness between husband and wife obedience to the law of chastity would diminish cries for abortion and would go a long way toward controlling sexually transmitted disease total fidelity in marriage would eliminate a major cause of divorce with its consequent pain and sadness inflicted especially upon innocent children of course members of the church have their share of faults and weaknesses but we see abundant evidence that living the gospel does help the saints to become better as more people commit themselves to living the gospel with all their heart might mind and strength they will be examples to their families and friends how blessed we are to understand and to have the privilege of living by the sacred eternal principles of the gospel of jesus christ they are true they will lead us along the only safe course to happiness which is the object and design of our existence teachings of the prophet joseph smith p 255 conclusion and promise in conclusion let me offer this advice and promise never be ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ partake of the sacrament worthily always remember our lord and savior never defame his sacred name do not ridicule the sacredness of the holy priesthood and the ordinances of the gospel if you honor this counsel the spirit of rebellion will never come into your hearts you will be blessed as was alma who said i have labored without ceasing that i might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which i did taste yea the lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors for because of the word which he has imparted unto me behold many have been born of god and have tasted as i have tasted alma 362426 in addition if you will sustain the lords anointed your confidence in them will wax strong your families and your posterity will be blessed and strengthened the abundant fruits of the gospel will enrich your lives peace and unity will fill your hearts and homes my brothers and sisters your leaders of the church love you and labor to bring you the fruits of the gospel that you may taste as we have tasted may you feel that marvelous joy of gods love and his blessings in your life i pray in the name of jesus christ amen
