listen to learn by elder russell m nelson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder russell m nelson in his invocation for this session of conference elder hugh w pinnock prayed that we might listen carefully many articles in church literature have dealt with the important art of listening1 they support a proverb that teaches this vital lesson hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayest be wise prov 19202 surely wisdom will come as we listen to learn from children parents partners neighbors church leaders and the lord children parents and teachers learn to listen then listen to learn from children a wise father once said i do a greater amount of good when i listen to my children than when i talk to them3 when our youngest daughter was about four years of age i came home from hospital duties quite late one evening i found my dear wife to be very weary i dont know why she only had nine children underfoot all day so i offered to get our fouryearold ready for bed i began to give the orders take off your clothes hang them up put on your pajamas brush your teeth say your prayers and so on commanding in a manner befitting a tough sergeant in the army suddenly she cocked her head to one side looked at me with a wistful eye and said daddy do you own me she taught me an important lesson i was using coercive methods on this sweet soul to rule children by force is the technique of satan not of the savior no we dont own our children our parental privilege is to love them to lead them and to let them go the time to listen is when someone needs to be heard children are naturally eager to share their experiences which range from triumphs of delight to trials of distress are we as eager to listen if they try to express their anguish is it possible for us to listen openly to a shocking experience without going into a state of shock ourselves can we listen without interrupting and without making snap judgments that slam shut the door of dialogue it can remain open with the soothing reassurance that we believe in them and understand their feelings adults should not pretend an experience did not happen just because they might wish otherwise even silence can be misinterpreted a story was written of a little boy who looked up at his mother and said why are you mad at me she answered im not angry at you what makes you say that well your hands are on your hips and you are not saying anything4 parents with teenage youth may find that time for listening is often less convenient but more important when young people feel lonely or troubled and when they seem to deserve favor least they may need it most wise parents and teachers listen to learn from children parents children of all ages learn to listen and listen to learn from parents as elder oaks taught us this morning spiritually or physically it can be a matter of life and death several years ago i was invited to give an important lecture at a medical school in new york city the night before the lecture sister nelson and i were invited to dinner at the home of our host professor there he proudly introduced us to an honor medical studenthis beautiful daughter some weeks later that professor telephoned me in an obvious state of grief i asked what is the matter remember our daughter whom you met at our home of course i replied ill never forget such a stunning young lady then her father sobbed and said last night she was killed in an automobile accident trying to gain composure he continued she asked permission to go to a dance with a certain young man i didnt have a good feeling about it i told her so and asked her not to go she asked why i simply told her that i was uneasy she had always been an obedient daughter but she said that if i could not give her a good reason to decline she wanted to go and so she did at the dance alcoholic beverages were served her escort drank a bitwe dont know how much while returning home he was driving too fast missed a turn and careened through a guardrail into a reservoir below they were both submerged and taken to their death as i shared my feeling of sadness he concluded my grief is made worse because i had the distinct feeling that trouble lay ahead why couldnt i have been more persuasive this experience will not have been in vain if others can listen and learn from it children honor your parents5 even when they cannot give a satisfactory explanation for their feelings please have faith in this scripture which applies to all age groups hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother prov 18 parents have a divine duty to teach their children to love the lord6 children have an equal obligation to obey their parents in the lord eph 617 wise children listen to learn from parents partners husbands and wives learn to listen and listen to learn from one another i was amused to read of an experience recorded by elder f burton howard in his biography of president marion g romney his goodhumored love for ida was manifested in many ways he delighted in telling of her hearing loss i once went to see a doctor about her hearing he would say he asked me how bad it was and i said i didnt know he told me to go home and find out the doctor instructed me to go into a far room and speak to her then i should move nearer and nearer until she does hear following the doctors instructions i spoke to her from the bedroom while she was in the kitchenno answer i moved nearer and spoke againno answer so i went right up to the door of the kitchen and said ida can you hear me she responded what is it marionive answered you three times8 even with normal hearing some couples seem not to listen to one another taking time to talk is essential to keep lines of communication intact if marriage is a prime relationship in life it deserves prime time yet less important appointments are often given priority leaving only leftover moments for listening to precious partners keeping the garden of marriage well cultivated and free from weeds of neglect requires the time and commitment of love it is not only a pleasant privilege it is a scriptural requirement with promise of eternal glory9 wise partners listen to learn from one another neighbors learn to listen and listen to learn from neighbors repeatedly the lord has said thou shalt love thy neighbour lev 1918 matt 191910 opportunities to listen to those of diverse religious or political persuasion can promote tolerance and learning and a good listener will listen to a persons sentiments as well i learned much from brother david m kennedy as we met with many dignitaries in nations abroad when one of them spoke brother kennedy not only looked eye to eye and listened with real intent but he even removed his reading glasses as if to show that he wanted nothing in the way of his total concentration the wise listen to learn from neighbors church leaders members learn to listen and listen to learn from church leaders faithful members love the savior and honor his servants having faith in the lords declaration that whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same dc 138 one day in italy i met a wonderful priesthood leader and his wife in him i saw a man with great potential but my language was foreign to them through an interpreter i challenged them to study the english language they listened obediently and studied diligently now six years later ably sustained by his wife carolina vincenzo conforte is faithfully serving his second assignment as a mission president interviewing missionaries well in italian or in english president ezra taft benson has proclaimed the importance of studying the book of mormon people throughout the earth are being blessed as they follow this and other counsel he has given gratefully we thank god for a prophet to guide us in these latter days but many turn a deaf ear to his teachings oblivious to his prophetic position they do so at great risk for scriptures contain this warning a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people acts 3222311 president j reuben clark jr said we do not lack a prophet what we lack is a listening ear12 words of the lord are taught by his disciples see dc 14 wise members listen to learn from church leaders the lord above all gods children should learn to listen then listen to learn from the lord on several sacred occasions in the worlds history our heavenly father has personally appeared to introduce his divine son with a specific charge to hear him13 jesus taught this first and great commandment thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind matt 2237 scriptures recorded in all dispensations teach that we show our love of god as we hearken to his commandments and obey them14 these actions are closely connected in fact the hebrew language of the old testament in most instances uses the same term for both hearkening to the lord and obedience to his word15 in addition to hearing the word of the lord obediently we manifest our love for god through prayer and listening is an essential part of prayer answers from the lord come ever so quietly hence he has counseled us to be still and know that i am god dc 10116 president spencer w kimball said it would not hurt us either if we paused at the end of our prayers to do some intense listeningeven for a moment or twoalways praying as the savior did not my will but thine be done luke 224216 in a world scarred by scourges of tyranny and war many of its inhabitants earnestly pray for inner peace for example not long ago a beautiful young mother named svetlana developed an intense desire to obtain a bible but in her city of leningrad a bible was very rare and expensive frequently and fervently she prayed for a bible ultimately she and her husband were impressed to travel with their small child to helsinki finland with that hope in mind there one day while walking in a park she stumbled across an object buried under the cover of autumn leaves she picked it up and found it to be a bible written in the russian language excitedly she recounted the story of this great discovery to another mother who was also in the park with her youngster the second mother rejoiced with svetlana and added would you like to have another book about jesus christ svetlana of course answered in the affirmative the other mother provided svetlana with a copy of a russianlanguage edition of the book of mormon and invited the family to church she eagerly embraced the teachings of the missionaries and shortly thereafter joined the church of jesus christ of latterday saints then they returned to their home where they have helped pioneer the work in the leningrad branch of the church17 her experience typifies this promise of the savior to those who seek him thus saith the lord god i will give unto the children of men line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a little and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts and lend an ear unto my counsel for they shall learn wisdom for unto him that receiveth i will give more 2 ne 2830 italics added18 while stressing the importance of listening well i am mindful of those who cannot hear many labeled as deaf have received the spirit by the hearing of faith gal 3219 the example of rachel ivins grant is inspiring to me she never complained about her own deafness though most women in their seventies would be completely worn out while rearing six growing children of another mother she undertook that task rachels deafness seemed to save her from the wear and tear of noise sometimes when two were arguing rachel would burst out laughing she said they had no idea how funny it was to see their angry faces and hear none of their words before her son heber j grant became the seventh president of the church she declared of course the greatest trial i have is that i cannot hear but i have so many blessings i cannot complain but if we only will live so that we may receive the instructions of god there is nothing we are called to pass through but will be for our good20 the redeemer loves such faithful souls for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers 1 pet 312 they qualify for this prophetic promise before they call i the lord will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear isa 6524 to all of gods children either able to hear or deaf to mortal sound he offers this reward incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live isa 55321 your soul will be blessed

italics added יקהה yiqq h h obedience to obey the children of ammon shall obey them isa 1114 italics added משמעת mishmaath audienceobedience that link between listening and obedience is found not only in hebrew but in latin and greek the word obey comes from two latin roots the prefix ob to or toward and the root audio audire to hear or to listen this root occurs in words such as audio audience or auditorium literally then the word obey means to hear or to listen toward that is to comply the word for obey in greek ὑπακούω hupakouo literally means listen under from hypo under as in hypodermic also in subjection or subordination and the root akouo hear listen as in acoustics in new testament times its use was gradually broadened to less sacred realms including expressions such as children obey parents see eph 61 col 320 wives obey husbands see 1 pet 31 servants obey masters see col 322 and so on a parallel pattern is found in the book of mormon use of terms such as listen hear and hearken written at the time of the old testament generally carried the same implication of obedience to deity those terms in book of mormon scriptures written after the earthly advent of christ were also broadened to include the more familiar usage as in the language of the new testament spencer w kimball we need a listening ear ensign nov 1979 pp 45 steven r mecham president of the finland
