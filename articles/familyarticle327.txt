these things are manifested unto us plainly by elaine l jack relief society general president imageelaine l jack my dear sisters its been heartwarming for me to receive so many good wishes from you during the past six months and to feel your acceptance many of you have told me that youre praying for our presidency we feel that spiritual strength and gratefully acknowledge itboth to you and to our father in heaven ive looked forward to this opportunity to speak to you as your relief society president and share the thoughts that many of you have shared with me both in person and in letter those thoughts echo a common theme sisters compare themselves to others for thirty years i have wanted to meet the woman against whom more latterday saint women have compared themselves than any other woman in the church shes often thought of as superwoman some call her the typical relief society sister the woman who makes fabulous bread plays the organ like a professional and dresses her impeccably groomed children in the clothes shes made where is she who is she what does she do that makes her seem beyond the reach of any woman ive made a careful study and ive found this woman tonight ill introduce you to our sister so we can see her as she is the prophet jacob taught the spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not wherefore it speaketh of things as they really are and of things as they really will be wherefore these things are manifested unto us plainly for the salvation of our souls jacob 413 dear sisters i wish to speak of things as they really are and of things as they really will be jacob 413 for many of us comparing ourselves to a practically perfect latterday saint woman is part of how things are while some of us are motivated and encouraged by such imagined or reallife models others of us are disheartened and discouraged by this same ideal womanwhether she is a composite of many women or someone of whom we have read or even someone we know as women make these comparisons i hear such comments as when they talk about being a good mother in relief society i always feel so guilty because sometimes i shout at my children im not comfortable in church because my husband isnt active i wish i didnt have to work but i need a paycheck to sustain my family ive heard im not a mother im not married and im most painfully aware of this in relief society and sacrament meeting i often go home feeling that they dont know what to do with me in the church these statements and others like them come i believe from unrealistic comparisons we make against some ideal because i know many of you i know of your goodness and your individual gifts from the lord i can see that these comparisons may keep you from achieving your potential and basking in associations that will enrich your lives and the lives of others sometimes the basis for these incorrect comparisons comes from other relief society sisters the relief society organization or expectations about roles in life whatever the origin the point of comparison is wrong unless it accounts for things as they really arenow and forever the prophet jacob said things as they really are and really will be are manifested unto us plainly for the salvation of our souls jacob 413 sisters how are these things manifest unto us plainly through the fulness of the gospel of jesus christ through the example of our saviors life only by living his gospel can we find what is real we can never accurately take the measure of our lives based on social economic ethnic age marital or physical conditions ask yourself are the comparisons you may make of yourself and others based on the model of the saviors life or do they come from trying to fit your life into the pattern of others lives sometimes comparisons creep up on us we sit in relief society surrounded by our neighbors and friends all of whom seem to raise the best children to teach the most profound lessons and to possess the greatest spirituality it can feel so discouraging some of you may say im just average theres nothing special about me or my life and yet what is manifested plainly to me is that you are extraordinary you whose average day is lived in accordance with our heavenly fathers laws no greater heroine lives in todays world than the woman who is quietly doing her part generally unsung you live everywhereyou live in nebraska or puerto rico or ghana or canada or czechoslovakia you show your love for the lord daily as you support husbands nurture children care for parents benefit neighbors serve in your schools sit on community councils and do much of the work of this world in and out of the home no one is more impressive than you i promised to introduce you to the typical relief society sister the good news is that she actually does exist the better news is that she is wonderful the best news is that shes you and this is who you really are 278 million of you live in 128 countries and territories across the globe from invercargill to edmonton from chicago to singapore 8000 of you are single fulltime missionaries 1700 are serving your mission as part of a couple you are raising 12 million children and a half million young women and onehalf million young men who are teenagers you made approximately one million visits to each other doing visiting teaching in just the first five months of 1990 if i could have the desire of my heart for you it would be that you feel valued for your own goodness the starting point is knowing that you are a daughter of god the young women say together each week we are daughters of our heavenly father who loves us and we love him we will stand as witnesses of god at all times and in all things and in all places see mosiah 189 the primary children sing i belong to the church of jesus christ of latterday saints i know who i am i know gods plan ill follow him in faith when my grandchildren and their parents sing this song together with great enthusiasm it brings tears of joy i know who i am i know gods plan and this knowledge makes all the difference we relief society sisters follow our motto charity never faileth this motto is very personal to me it means that we love our heavenly father and we best express that love through all that we do for others to rejoice in being a daughter of god to know gods plan and to follow the saviors example of servicethese things are real the savior taught the samaritan woman at jacobs well whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not john 41415 a relief society sister in ghana visits a woman who thirsts for truth but cannot read to give her sister the opportunity to drink deeply of gospel truths the visiting teacher tries to be with her as often as possible she reads the scriptures to her sister and explains their meaning in her native tongue weve learned of a remarkable peppy saintly 60yearold woman she lives in czechoslovakia she is one of the handful of saints who has remained active during the fortyyear slumber when that country was denied full religious opportunity the sister shares the gospels living water as she takes an 83yearold branch president for a walk each day and does his shopping for him he requires two canes for walking and shopping in czechoslovakia is no small task through their daily acts of service these women partake of and pass on to others the water springing up into eternal life another of you wrote i love being a mother i love teaching my children the gospel i substituted in relief society one week and got to give the lesson on family scripture study this is something close to my heart something i cant imagine family life without after the lesson a sister came up to me and said i cant believe all you do i dont have the patience but she sings and takes music lessons at times ive envied people who could sing well or play an instrument because i love music after my conversation with her i felt that although i had not been blessed with great musical ability heavenly father had blessed me with a love of motherhood and that this indeed was a gift and a talent for which i am grateful isnt the point of these three examples that each of these sisters serves as she is able according to the needs around her isnt that the point of your life look at all you do you make quilts for orphans and visit women in prison you change countless diapers and kiss away endless tears you collect clothing for earthquake victims you tutor underachieving children in the church you preside teach counsel visit teach and render countless other acts of service you may serve as relief society president or librarian or star a teacher or gospel doctrine teacher all you do blesses children youth women and men in every unit of the church our focus in relief society for this new decade reflects our quest for things that are real and for the salvation of our souls our focus reflects our love and admiration for you our sisters we want you to live lives of spiritual maturity and fulfillment free of unrealistic comparisons in relief society we focus on these five points first build personal testimony this means leading lives of faith and hope and becoming thoughtful prayerful disciples of our savior second bless the individual woman i believe in you i delight in our diversity as relief society women and the joy we find in righteous living the prophet nephi tells us behold the lord esteemeth all flesh in one he that is righteous is favored of god 1 ne 1735 third develop and exercise charity our relief society motto charity never faileth is worth living by the challenge ahead is to become more active in meeting the real needs of the world around usloneliness neglect illiteracy homelessness fourth strengthen families in the many types of family units we love and nourish each other as we unite our efforts to become better disciples of our savior and then fifth enjoy a unified sisterhood as we share our faith our experiences and our ideas in loving friendship build bless develop and exercise strengthen and enjoythese are propelling motivating action words that invite our personal best our goal is that each of you enjoys the process of life build your own personal testimony and rejoice with me in being a typical relief society woman these things are realtestimony individuality charity families sisterhood these are real
