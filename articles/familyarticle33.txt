teaching in the homea joyful and sacred responsibility by devin g durrant first counselor in the sunday school general presidency imagedevin g durrant i plead for heavens help as we strive to be christlike teachers in our homes my dear wife julie and i have raised six precious children and we recently became empty nesters how i miss having our children in our home on a fulltime basis i miss learning from them and teaching them today i direct my remarks to all parents and all who desire to be parents many of you are raising children now for others that time might come soon and for still others parenthood may be a future blessing i pray we all recognize the joyful and sacred responsibility it is to teach a child1 as parents we introduce our children to heavenly father and his son jesus christ we help our children say their first prayer we offer guidance and support as they enter the covenant path2 through baptism we teach them to obey gods commandments we educate them about his plan for his children and we help them recognize the whisperings of the holy ghost we tell them stories of ancient prophets and encourage them to follow living ones we pray for their triumphs and ache with them during their trials we testify to our children of temple blessings and we strive to prepare them well to serve fulltime missions we offer loving counsel as our children become parents themselves buteven thenwe never stop being their parents we never stop being their teachers we are never released from these eternal callings today lets contemplate a few of the wonderful opportunities we have to teach our children in our homes family home evening teaching lets begin with family home evening which was a high priority in the faithfilled home where i was raised i dont remember specific lessons taught at family home evening but i do remember that we never missed a week3 i knew what was important to my parents4 i recall one of my favorite family home evening activities dad would invite one of his children to take the test he would give the child a series of instructions like first go into the kitchen and open and close the fridge then run into my bedroom and grab a pair of socks from my dresser then come back to me jump up and down three times and say dad i did it i loved it when it was my turn i wanted to get every step just right and i cherished the moment when i could say dad i did it this activity helped build my confidence and made it easier for a restless boy to pay attention when mom or dad taught a gospel principle president gordon b hinckley counseled if you have any doubt about the virtue of family home evening try it gather your children about you teach them bear testimony to them read the scriptures together and have a good time together5 there will always be opposition to holding family home evening6 regardless i invite you to find a way around the obstacles and make family home evening a priorityand make fun a key ingredient family prayer teaching family prayer is another prime opportunity to teach i love how president n eldon tanners father taught him during family prayer president tanner said this i remember one evening when we were kneeling in family prayer my father said to the lord eldon did something today he shouldnt have done hes sorry and if you will forgive him he wont do it anymore that made me determined not to do it anymoremuch more than a trouncing would have done7 as a boy i would sometimes get irritated with our seemingly excessive family prayers thinking to myself didnt we just pray a few minutes ago now as a parent i know we cant ever pray too much as a family8 ive always been impressed with how heavenly father introduces jesus christ as his beloved son9 i enjoy praying for my children by name as they listen to me express to heavenly father how beloved they are to me it seems there is no better time to communicate love to our children than when praying with them or blessing them when families gather in humble prayer powerful and lasting lessons are taught oncall teaching parental teaching is like being an oncall physician we always need to be ready to teach our children because we never know when the opportunity will present itself imagejesus teaching the woman at the well we are like the savior whose teaching often did not happen in a synagogue but in informal everyday settingswhile eating a meal with his disciples drawing water from a well or walking past a fig tree10 years ago my mother shared that her two best gospel conversations with my older brother matt were once while she was folding laundry and another time while driving him to the dentist one of the many things i admired about my mother was her readiness to teach her children her parental teaching never ended while i was serving as a bishop my mom then 78 years old told me i needed a haircut she knew i needed to be an example and she didnt hesitate to tell me so i love you mom as a father i am motivated to personally study and ponder the scriptures in order to be able to respond when my children or grandchildren present an oncall teaching opportunity11 some of the best teaching moments start as a question or concern in the heart of a family member12 are we listening during those moments13 i love the apostle peters invitation be ready always to give an answer to every man and i add child that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you14 when i was a teenager my dad and i enjoyed challenging each other to see who had the strongest grip we would squeeze the others hand as tightly as possible in an effort to make the other grimace in pain it doesnt seem like much fun now but somehow it was at the time after one such battle dad looked me in the eyes and said you have strong hands son i hope your hands always have the strength to never touch a young lady inappropriately he then invited me to stay morally clean and help others do the same elder douglas l callister shared this about his father while traveling home from work one day father spontaneously said i paid my tithing today i wrote thank you on the tithing check i am so grateful to the lord for blessing our family elder callister then paid this tribute to his fatherteacher he taught both acts and attitudes of obedience15 i think it wise to ask ourselves occasionally what will i teach or what am i teaching my children by my acts and attitudes of obedience family scripture study teaching family scripture study is an ideal forum for teaching doctrine in the home president russell m nelson said not only are parents to cling to the word of the lord but they have a divine mandate to teach it to their children16 as julie and i raised our children we tried to be consistent and creative one year we decided to read the book of mormon in spanish as a family was that why the lord called each of our children who served a fulltime mission to a spanishspeaking mission es posible i was deeply touched when brother brian k ashton shared with me that he and his father read every page of the book of mormon together during his senior year of high school brother ashton loves the scriptures they are written in his mind and on his heart his father planted that seed when brother ashton was a teenager and that seed17 has grown into a deeprooted tree of truth brother ashton has done the same with his older children18 his eightyearold son recently asked him dad when do i get to read the book of mormon with you example teaching lastly our most impactful parental teaching is our example we are counseled to be an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity19 during a recent trip julie and i attended church and saw this verse in action a young man soon to leave for his mission spoke in sacrament meeting he said you all think my dad is such a good man at church but he paused and i anxiously wondered what he might say next he continued and said hes a better man at home imagestewart family i thanked this young man afterward for the inspiring tribute he had paid his father i then found out that his father was the bishop of the ward even though this bishop was serving his ward faithfully his son felt that his best work was done at home20 elder d todd christofferson counsels we have many avenues for teaching the rising generation and we should devote our best thinking and effort to taking full advantage of them above all we must continue to encourage and help parents be better and more consistent teachers especially by example21 thats how the savior teaches22 last year while on vacation with our two youngest children julie suggested we do proxy baptisms in both the st george and san diego temples i murmuredto myselfthinking we attend the temple at home and now were on vacation why not do something more vacationlike after the baptisms julie wanted to take pictures outside the temple i silently murmuredagain you can guess what happened next we took pictures imagedurrants at san diego california temple imagedurrants at st george utah temple julie wants our children to have memories of how we helped our ancestors and so do i we didnt need a formal lesson on the importance of temples we were living itthanks to a mother who loves the temple and wants her children to share that love as parents cherish each other and offer righteous examples children are eternally blessed conclusion for all of you who are striving to do your best to teach in your homes may you find peace and joy in your efforts and if you feel you have room for improvement or need greater preparation please humbly respond as the spirit prompts you and bind yourself to act23 elder l tom perry said the health of any society the happiness of its people their prosperity and their peace all find common roots in the teaching of children in the home24 yes my home nest is now empty but im still on call ready and eager to find additional precious opportunities to teach my grown children their children and someday i hope their children i plead for heavens help as we strive to be christlike teachers in our homes in the name of jesus christ amen

what they remember about family prayer scripture study and family home evening i believe i know how they would answer they likely would not identify a particular prayer or a specific instance of scripture study or an especially meaningful family home evening lesson as the defining moment in their spiritual development what they would say they remember is that as a family we were consistent
