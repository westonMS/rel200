an eternal key by elder durrel a woolsey of the seventy imageelder durrel a woolsey my beloved brethren of the priesthood the lord jesus christ said for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul mark 836 could we add lose his own soul and his family as i left california bound for salt lake city to receive training and be set apart for a mission in arizona i experienced for a moment an alarming feeling i had lost all of my keys the keys to the cars home business and church calling had been left behind i had the depressing feeling that i no longer had any keys even my pockets seemed empty then came the exhilarating thought that i still had the most important key of all a key that i will hold eternally if i remain worthy that key of course is the patriarchal key with my family i became aware of how temporary most other keys are especially keys that control material things that will one day become victims of moth and rust priesthood keys of leadership and other keys of presidency are extremely vital but for the most part even they are temporary in nature eventually after faithfully serving you will then relinquish those keys to someone else we will however be blessed to continue to hold our patriarchal key fathers you hold the key to accomplish the work stated by several of the prophets as vitally important president harold b lee said the most important work you will ever do will be done within the walls of your own home and president david o mckay cautioned that no other success can compensate for failure in the home many in the world are alarmed and with some justification at the plight and deteriorating condition of families the most powerful thrust toward a resolution of this significant problem would be an honorable father full of integrity and fidelity giving righteous leadership to his family that joyful work and calling is to do whatever is necessary to chart a course for you and your family to unitedly return and live with heavenly father we likely will not be called upon to endure the great physical hardships suffered by so many of our pioneer forefathers ours is a much more sinister and demoralizing challenge often this challenge will approach cloaked in confusing masks of misunderstood rights and agency or the enticements and allurements of a misguided world we daily face the anything for a thrill crowd or the whats in it for me society the antichrist korihor in the book of mormon taught a similar type of damaging doctrine when he said there could be no atonement made for the sins of men but every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature therefore every man prospered according to his genius and that every man conquered according to his strength and whatsoever a man did was no crime alma 3017 this rhetoric could blend into much of the accepted doctrine of the world today so where is safety how does a father go about safely guiding his most priceless possession through the reefs and shoals dad you need to be a hero in your family they need a hero they will have strong peer pressure and temptation to adopt the socalled heroes of today who are not worthy of their attention and most certainly not their emulation the heroes or superstars in the sports and entertainment world and there are many frequently become examples of dishonesty instability and infidelity they flagrantly and indifferently flaunt those weaknesses of character and immorality before a doting and accepting world as korihor said according to the management of the creature alma 3017 could not should not father become the hero to his family a father worthy of attention worthy of emulation most certainly but how first of all a generous amount of your time is required not a superficial moment here and there not the tired and wornout phrase well talk about that later but an honest generous piece of your day on a continuing basis even at the sacrifice of things social things personally entertaining or even things financially rewarding all of the money in the world significant worldly accomplishments which may include the upper rungs of the success ladder or the personal enjoyment of athletic and sporting activities will not return you and your family intact to live with heavenly father president joseph f smith quoted from the savior as stated in mark for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul mark 836 then president smith continued what would it profit me though i should go out into the world and win strangers to the fold of god and lose my own children oh god let me not lose my own i can not afford to lose mine whom god has given to me and whom i am responsible for before the lord and who are dependent upon me for guidance for instruction for proper influence gospel doctrine salt lake city deseret book co 1975 p 462 the salvation of our families will require all that we have to save all that we have so you will make the time commitment great positive wonderful benefits will begin to flow to you and your family almost immediately so what next i mentioned fidelity it is absolutely essential that you set an undeviating course of loyalty and faithfulness to your companion to whom you have previously made these very commitments and promises the example of your great love and respect for her the two of you being as one will establish a singular guiding strength that your children will desire to follow your voices and actions blending together in a united front as you teach and lead your little family will be the trumpet with a certain sound of strength and unity leading to safety synonyms of fidelity are allegiance and devotion they will be critical supports to your foundation of fidelity thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart and shalt cleave unto her and none else dc 4222 father one of your greatest resources will be the scriptures you would not consider making a large investment in a rather complicated and technical piece of equipment then begin its operation without an involved study of the handbook of instruction further you would likely reference that handbook often the handbook of instructions for your somewhat complicated very sizable investment called family is certainly the original handbook of instructionthat being our beloved scriptures they are complete with instructions and examples often you will find the answer before the question is asked daily research is required it is also vital to maintain open communication lines with the fountainhead of all wisdom and truth through your daily family and personal prayers finally what better resource for direction could we have than a living prophet a great safetynet can envelop you and your family as you follow the brethren how blessed you are dad to have living oracles of god to update you with current instruction to guide your family through modernday challenges to not hear or ignore them to not understand and heed those instructions would be like beginning a trip across the sea in a small boat without a compass well thats it dad you must become the family hero worthy of not only their attention but their emulation this will require your constant investment of sufficient time complete emotional and physical fidelity with unity of purpose between you and your eternal companion this will require your constant dependency upon the lord demonstrated through scripture study and prayer this will require that you follow the brethren in every sense of the wordhearing understanding and doing this simple formula will unite and strengthen your beloved family and bring countless blessings from our father may god bless all fathers to righteously obtain and maintain this patriarchal key to the blessing of families throughout the church in the name of jesus christ amen
