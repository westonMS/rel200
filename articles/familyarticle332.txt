who is a true friend by elder malcolm s jeppsen of the seventy imageelder malcolm s jeppsen a year ago when i was called as a seventy a nonmember patient of mine asked me an interesting question she wanted to know if a seventy was higher or lower in the mormon church than a bishop when i asked her why she would ask such a question she replied that she was interested to know just what id be doing she said she understood that in the mormon church every calling from a bishop on down was all work and everyone from a bishop on up was all talk this may be the reason for my wanting to talk tonight to you aaronic priesthood brethren many of you during your lifetime have had a pet that may have come to a tragic end with sad moments following some years ago while traveling on a family vacation we acquired a rather unusual pet which was a small friendly nottoolong water snake from the beaches of puget sound my children named him sneaky as short for sneaky snake early one morning while the family was off walking near the motel sneaky somehow got out of his cardboard box when the room attendant entered to tidy up the room in our absence sneaky seeing the open door headed for it she slammed the door shut in absolute terror and since sneaky got caught in the door we might say he came all apart it was the end of sneaky the beginning of a nervous breakdown for the girl attendant and a time of weeping and disappointment on the part of our children now there is a lesson here the attendant had erroneously perceived sneaky as something less than the friend he was weve heard from bishop hales tonight about true friends may i add a thought or two about them all of us may have been at one time or other confused as to just who our true friends are let me give you an example of what i mean as it relates to the word of wisdom some years ago in my medical office i had occasion to examine a young man who was approximately the same age as you young men of the aaronic priesthood i was puzzled by what seemed to be his medical problem after several tests and xrays i found myself amazed at the diagnosis he was an alcoholic at his young age he told me that he had begun having alcoholic drinks at a very early age due to the encouragement of his socalled friends i wondered to myself are friends that encourage us to break the word of wisdom really our true friends phrases like just try it once or everybody does it or who is going to know are all too commonly used if they were true friends would they pressure us that way indeed in life it may be difficult to tell at times just who our true friends are were my young patients friends the kind he should strive to keep the room attendant perceived sneaky as a potentially harmful enemy instead of a friend and yet the reverse was true a true friend of yours and mine gave us the word of wisdom through his prophet joseph smith medical research tells us that by far the majority of young people who begin using alcohol or tobacco products do so with the urging of their friends the lord has told us that neither strong drinks meaning alcoholic drinks nor tobacco are for the body and that they are not good for man let me talk to you rather plainly my young friends as a physician who for forty years has witnessed firsthand the truth of those statements in the word of wisdom i testify that they are true the beautiful scenes in magazine advertisements are not what the end results of cigarette smoking prove to be this advertising in these magazines and newspapers is very deceptive the end results are not nearly so pretty they are oxygen masks and intravenous medication and literally hours of pain misery and gasping for breath remember that approximately 5000 people a day quit smoking and another 1000every single daydie from cigarette smoking or one in every ninety seconds in the united states alone this means that each day 6000 people either kick the habit or kick the bucket no wonder the cigarette companies spend billions to keep their unwitting customers buying their lethal wares i had my own comment printed and pasted on all cigarette advertising in the magazines of my medical office waiting room it states many of the ads in this magazine are misleading deceptive and are a ripoff for example smoking does not make one glamorous macho or athletic it does make one sick poor and dead how true this is smoking is indeed becoming less and less popular as the heavy smokers one by one pass on if an industrial accident killed everyone in the entire salt lake valley the nation would be horrified that however is the scale of the annual tobacco disaster one out of every six people that die in the united states dies as a result of smoking almost inevitably the user of hard drugs begins first with alcohol or tobacco both of which are drugs of the highly addicting kind themselves in addition the real damage from the use of these things is usually even more severe to our spiritual lives than it is to our physical bodies now would a true friend be one to entice you to use them im sure he wouldnt look closely at your friends cultivate good friends theyre so valuable remember the savior valued his friends so highly that he would lay down his life for them he had this to say about friends greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends john 1513 and then he went on to say ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you john 151415 friendship is an extremely important part of your life someone has said a true friend is someone who makes it easier to live the gospel of jesus christ many of you young men will be at some time or another approached by one or more of your friends who will entice you to do something you know you should not doit might be something you know deep down inside will hurt your parents and your father in heaven it may be violating the word of wisdom for example or committing moral transgression which is so displeasing to the lord no one will ever know the socalled friends will tell you besides what difference will it make my young friends you dont have to reject your friends who are on the wrong path you dont even have to give them up necessarily you can be their caring friend ready to help them when they are ready to be helped you can talk to them and lift them and bear your testimony to them lead them by example but dont ever be led into displeasing your father in heaven by your friends who might ask that as a condition of being your friend you must choose between their way and the lords way if that happens choose the lords way and look for new friends especially important are our friends in times of need when we may have feelings of loneliness or despair true friends will stand by you when the prophet joseph smith was incarcerated in that terrible liberty jail he was told by the lord thy friends do stand by thee and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands thou art not yet as job thy friends do not contend against thee neither charge thee with transgression as they did job dc 121910 knowing his friends would stand by him was a great assurance to joseph smith during this trying experience some of the most trusted and loving friends you will ever have on this earth are your parents and family it may be that only when you have children of your own will you fully appreciate the bonds of love that exist between parents and children youll find as you grow into manhood that advice from your parents as to who should or should not be your true friends will be very reliable and valuable to you cultivate our savior and redeemer jesus christ as your friend above all being his friend will without exception lift your vision and bring you comfort guidance peace and yes even the companionship of other true friends i know something of his love his compassion his mercy and the help one may receive from him and the holy spirit he has promised that by obedience to his word you shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge even hidden treasures dc 8919 just think with jesus as your friend you may receive increased strength and testimony that will uphold you against temptations when they arise choose your friends wisely they will provide the foundation of spiritual strength that will enable you to make difficult extremely important decisions correctly when they come in your life above all be a friend of the savior you my young men are the honored holders of a royal priesthood if you have not done so previously now is the time to let him know you consider him your true friend and that you will be a true friend of his that we may all qualify to be his disciples his friends i pray in the name of jesus christ amen
