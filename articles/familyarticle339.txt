need to know that even when it seems that no one else cares your heavenly father does he will always love you he wants you to be protected and safe if you are not please talk to someone who can help youa parent a teacher your bishop or a friend they will help you i am sure each of you has favorite stories from the scriptures one of my favorite stories is found in the seventeenth chapter of 3 nephi in the book of mormon it tells about the visit of jesus to the people on the american continent after his resurrection it tells about jesus healing the sick and teaching the people and praying to heavenly father for them now this is one of my favorite parts of that story and it came to pass that when jesus had made an end of praying unto the father he arose but so great was the joy of the multitude that they were overcome and it came to pass that jesus spake unto them and bade them arise and they arose from the earth and he said unto them blessed are ye because of your faith and now behold my joy is full and when he had said these words he wept and the multitude bare record of it and he took their little children one by one and blessed them and prayed unto the father for them and when he had done this he wept again and he spake unto the multitude and said unto them behold your little ones and as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven and they saw the heavens open and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire and they came down and encircled those little ones about and they were encircled about with fire and the angels did minister unto them 3 ne 171824 i promise you dear children that angels will minister unto you also you may not see them but they will be there to help you and you will feel of their presence favored little ones were they who towards him jesus drew who within his arms he took just as loving parents do christ the lord our living head this of little children said such shall of my kingdom be suffer them to come to me listen to the saviors plea let the children come to me let the little children come sing with me b14 dear children our heavenly father sent you to earth at this time because you are some of his most valiant children he knew there would be much wickedness in the world today and he knew you could be faithful and obedient dear child you are gods gift to your parents and the gift your parents can give god is to bring you back to him sweet and pure and faithful he expects your parents and leaders to teach you to walk beside you and to be shining examples to you so that you will know the way you should go they must spend time with you and love you and pray with you and for you your leaders must call faithful men and women to teach you in primary we must provide experiences for you early in your life that will help you know how to live the gospel god bless the children of this church how i love you how heavenly father loves you and may we as your parents teachers and leaders be more childlikemore submissive more meek and more humble i close my message to you this day with the prayer that we may ever respond to your plea as you so sweetly sing teach me to walk in
