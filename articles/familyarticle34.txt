the plan and the proclamation by elder dallin h oaks of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder dallin h oaks the family proclamation is the lords reemphasis of the gospel truths we need to sustain us through current challenges to the family as is evident in our family proclamation members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints are blessed with unique doctrine and different ways of viewing the world we participate and even excel in many worldly activities but on some subjects we forgo participation as we seek to follow the teachings of jesus christ and his apostles ancient and modern i in a parable jesus described those who hear the word but become unfruitful when that word is choked by the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches matthew 1322 later jesus corrected peter for not savoring the things that be of god but those that be of men declaring for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul matthew 1623 26 in his final teachings in mortality he told his apostles if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world the world hateth you john 1519 see also john 1714 16 similarly the writings of jesuss early apostles frequently use the image of the world to represent opposition to gospel teachings be not conformed to this world romans 122 the apostle paul taught for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god 1 corinthians 319 and beware he warned lest any man spoil you after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ colossians 28 the apostle james taught that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god james 44 the book of mormon often uses this image of the opposition of the world nephi prophesied the ultimate destruction of those who are built up to become popular in the eyes of the world and those who seek the things of the world 1 nephi 2223 see also 2 nephi 930 alma condemned those who were puffed up with the vain things of the world alma 3127 lehis dream shows that those who seek to follow the iron rod the word of god will encounter the opposition of the world the occupants of the great and spacious building lehi saw were mocking and pointing the finger of scorn 1 nephi 82627 33 in his vision interpreting this dream nephi learned that this ridicule and opposition came from the multitudes of the earth the world and the wisdom thereof the pride of the world 1 nephi 113436 imageportrait of president thomas s monson what is the meaning of these scriptural cautions and commandments not to be of the world or the modern commandment to forsake the world dc 532 president thomas s monson summarized these teachings we must be vigilant in a world which has moved so far from that which is spiritual it is essential that we reject anything that does not conform to our standards refusing in the process to surrender that which we desire most eternal life in the kingdom of god1 god created this earth according to his plan to provide his spirit children a place to experience mortality as a necessary step toward the glories he desires for all his children while there are various kingdoms and glories our heavenly fathers ultimate desire for his children is what president monson called eternal life in the kingdom of god which is exaltation in families this is more than salvation president russell m nelson has reminded us in gods eternal plan salvation is an individual matter but exaltation is a family matter2 the restored gospel of jesus christ and the inspired family proclamation which i will discuss later are essential teachings to guide mortal preparation for exaltation even as we must live with the marriage laws and other traditions of a declining world those who strive for exaltation must make personal choices in family life according to the lords way whenever that differs from the worlds way in this mortal life we have no memory of what preceded our birth and we now experience opposition we grow and mature spiritually by choosing to obey gods commandments in a succession of right choices these include covenants and ordinances and repentance when our choices are wrong in contrast if we lack faith in gods plan and are disobedient to or deliberately refrain from its required actions we forgo that growth and maturity the book of mormon teaches this life is the time for men to prepare to meet god alma 3432 ii latterday saints who understand gods plan of salvation have a unique worldview that helps them see the reason for gods commandments the unchangeable nature of his required ordinances and the fundamental role of our savior jesus christ our saviors atonement reclaims us from death and subject to our repentance saves us from sin with that worldview latterday saints have distinctive priorities and practices and are blessed with the strength to endure the frustrations and pains of mortal life inevitably the actions of those who try to follow gods plan of salvation can cause misunderstanding or even conflict with family members or friends who do not believe its principles such conflict is always so every generation that has sought to follow gods plan has had challenges anciently the prophet isaiah gave strength to the israelites whom he called ye that know righteousness in whose heart is my law to them he said fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid of their revilings isaiah 517 see also 2 nephi 87 but whatever the cause of conflict with those who do not understand or believe gods plan those who do understand are always commanded to choose the lords way instead of the worlds way iii the gospel plan each family should follow to prepare for eternal life and exaltation is outlined in the churchs 1995 proclamation the family a proclamation to the world3 its declarations are of course visibly different from some current laws practices and advocacy of the world in which we live in our day the differences most evident are cohabitation without marriage samesex marriage and the raising of children in such relationships those who do not believe in or aspire to exaltation and are most persuaded by the ways of the world consider this family proclamation as just a statement of policy that should be changed in contrast latterday saints affirm that the family proclamation defines the kind of family relationships where the most important part of our eternal development can occur we have witnessed a rapid and increasing public acceptance of cohabitation without marriage and of samesex marriage the corresponding media advocacy education and even occupational requirements pose difficult challenges for latterday saints we must try to balance the competing demands of following the gospel law in our personal lives and teachings even as we seek to show love for all4 in doing so we sometimes face but need not fear what isaiah called the reproach of men converted latterday saints believe that the family proclamation issued nearly a quarter century ago and now translated into scores of languages is the lords reemphasis of the gospel truths we need to sustain us through current challenges to the family two examples are samesex marriage and cohabitation without marriage just 20 years after the family proclamation the united states supreme court authorized samesex marriage overturning thousands of years of marriage being limited to a man and a woman the shocking percentage of united states children born to a mother not married to the father came more gradually 5 percent in 19605 32 percent in 19956 and now 40 percent7 iv the family proclamation begins by declaring that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of god and that the family is central to the creators plan for the eternal destiny of his children it also affirms that gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose it further declares that god has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman lawfully wedded as husband and wife the proclamation affirms the continuing duty of husband and wife to multiply and replenish the earth and their solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity it solemnly warns against the abuse of spouse or offspring and it affirms that happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the lord jesus christ finally it calls for the promotion of official measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society in 1995 a president of the church and 14 other apostles of the lord issued these important doctrinal statements as one of only seven of those apostles still living i feel obliged to share what led to the family proclamation for the information of all who consider it the inspiration identifying the need for a proclamation on the family came to the leadership of the church over 23 years ago it was a surprise to some who thought the doctrinal truths about marriage and the family were well understood without restatement8 nevertheless we felt the confirmation and we went to work subjects were identified and discussed by members of the quorum of the twelve for nearly a year language was proposed reviewed and revised prayerfully we continually pleaded with the lord for his inspiration on what we should say and how we should say it we all learned line upon line precept upon precept as the lord has promised dc 9812 imageportrait of president gordon b hinckley during this revelatory process a proposed text was presented to the first presidency who oversee and promulgate church teachings and doctrine after the presidency made further changes the proclamation on the family was announced by the president of the church gordon b hinckley in the womens meeting of september 23 1995 he introduced the proclamation with these words with so much of sophistry that is passed off as truth with so much of deception concerning standards and values with so much of allurement and enticement to take on the slow stain of the world we have felt to warn and forewarn9 i testify that the proclamation on the family is a statement of eternal truth the will of the lord for his children who seek eternal life it has been the basis of church teaching and practice for the last 22 years and will continue so for the future consider it as such teach it live by it and you will be blessed as you press forward toward eternal life forty years ago president ezra taft benson taught that every generation has its tests and its chance to stand and prove itself10 i believe our attitude toward and use of the family proclamation is one of those tests for this generation i pray for all latterday saints to stand firm in that test i close with president gordon b hinckleys teachings uttered two years after the family proclamation was announced he said i see a wonderful future in a very uncertain world if we will cling to our values if we will build on our inheritance if we will walk in obedience before the lord if we will simply live the gospel we will be blessed in a magnificent and wonderful way we will be looked upon as a peculiar people who have found the key to a peculiar happiness11 i testify of the truth and eternal importance of the family proclamation revealed by the lord jesus christ to his apostles for the exaltation of the children of god see doctrine and covenants 13114 in the name of jesus christ amen
