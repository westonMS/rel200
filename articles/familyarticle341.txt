the canker of contention by elder russell m nelson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder russell m nelson some months ago my esteemed colleague elder carlos e asay and i stood atop mount nebo where moses once stood see deut 3414 we saw what he saw in the distance to our right was the sea of galilee the river jordan flowed from there to the dead sea on our left ahead was the promised land into which joshua led the israelite faithful so long ago later we were permitted to do what moses could not we were escorted from the hashemite kingdom of jordan to its western border with israel from there we and our associates walked over the allenby bridge we felt the tension as armed soldiers nearby guarded both sides of the international boundary after safely enduring this experience i thought of the irony of it all here in the land made holy by the prince of peace contention has existed almost continuously from that day to this prior to his ascension from the holy land the savior pronounced a unique blessing peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you john 1427 his peace is not necessarily political his peace is personal but that spirit of inner peace is driven away by contention contention does not usually begin as strife between countries more often it starts with an individual for we can contend within ourselves over simple matters of right and wrong from there contention can infect neighbors and nations like a spreading sore as we dread any disease that undermines the health of the body so should we deplore contention which is a corroding canker of the spirit i appreciate the counsel of abraham lincoln who said quarrel not at all no man resolved to make the most of himself can spare time for personal contention better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him letter to j m cutts 26 oct 1863 in concise lincoln dictionary of thoughts and statements comp and arr ralph b winn new york new york philosophical library 1959 p 107 president ezra taft benson in his keynote address yesterday described contention as another face of pride my concern is that contention is becoming accepted as a way of life from what we see and hear in the media the classroom and the workplace all are now infected to some degree with contention how easy it is yet how wrong it is to allow habits of contention to pervade matters of spiritual significance because contention is forbidden by divine decree the lord god hath commanded that men should not murder that they should not lie that they should not steal that they should not take the name of the lord their god in vain that they should not envy that they should not have malice that they should not contend one with another 2 ne 2632 creator of contention to understand why the lord has commanded us not to contend one with another we must know the true source of contention a book of mormon prophet revealed this important knowledge even before the birth of christ satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually yea he did go about spreading rumors and contentions upon all the face of the land that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good and against that which should come hel 1622 when christ did come to the nephites he confirmed that prophecy he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me saith the lord but is of the devil who is the father of contention and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger one with another behold this is not my doctrine to stir up the hearts of men with anger one against another but this is my doctrine that such things should be done away 3 ne 112930 origin of contention contention existed before the earth was formed when gods plan for creation and mortal life on the earth was first announced sons and daughters of god shouted for joy the plan was dependent on mans agency his subsequent fall from the presence of god and the merciful provision of a savior to redeem mankind scriptures reveal that lucifer sought vigorously to amend the plan by destroying the agency of man satans cunning motive was unmasked in his statement behold here am i send me i will be thy son and i will redeem all mankind that one soul shall not be lost and surely i will do it wherefore give me thine honor moses 41 satans selfish efforts to alter the plan of god resulted in great contention in heaven the prophet joseph smith explained jesus said there would be certain souls that would not be saved and the devil said he could save them all and laid his plans before the grand council who gave their vote in favor of jesus christ so the devil rose up in rebellion against god and was cast down teachings of the prophet joseph smith sel joseph fielding smith salt lake city deseret book co 1938 p 357 this war in heaven was not a war of bloodshed it was a war of conflicting ideasthe beginning of contention scriptures repeatedly warn that the father of contention opposes the plan of our heavenly father satans method relies on the infectious canker of contention satans motive to gain personal acclaim even over god himself targets of the adversary the work of the adversary may be likened to loading guns in opposition to the work of god salvos containing germs of contention are aimed and fired at strategic targets essential to that holy work these vital targets includein addition to the individualthe family leaders of the church and divine doctrine the family the family has been under attack ever since satan first taunted adam and eve see gen 3 moses 4 so today each must guard against the hazard of contention in the family it usually begins innocently years ago when our daughters were little girls who wanted to be big girls the style of the day was to wear multiple petticoats a little contention could have crept in as the girls soon learned that the one to get dressed first was the one best dressed in a large family of boys those with the longest reach were the best fed in order to avoid obvious contention they adopted a rule that required them at mealtime to leave at least one foot on the floor the home is the great laboratory of learning and love here parents help children overcome these natural tendencies to be selfish in rearing our own family sister nelson and i have been very grateful for this counsel from the book of mormon ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry or naked neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of god and fight and quarrel one with another but ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness ye will teach them to love one another and to serve one another mosiah 41415 and i might add please be patient while children learn those lessons parents should be partners to cherish and protect one another knowing that the aim of the adversary is to destroy the integrity of the family leaders of the church leaders of the church are targets for attack by those who stir contention this is true even though not a single leader has called himself or herself to a position of responsibility each general authority for instance chose another path to pursue as his lifes occupation but the reality is as with peter or paul each was surely called of god by prophecy and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority a of f 15 with that call comes the commitment to emulate the patterns of the prince of peace that goal is shared by worthy servants of the master who would not speak ill of the lords anointed nor provoke contention over teachings declared by ancient or living prophets certainly no faithful follower of god would promote any cause even remotely related to religion if rooted in controversy because contention is not of the lord surely a stalwart would not lend his or her good name to periodicals programs or forums that feature offenders who do sow discord among brethren prov 619 see also prov 614 such agitators unfortunately fulfill longforetold prophecy they take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed ps 22 yet mercifully the anointed pray for those who attack them knowing the sad fate prophesied for their attackers see dc 1211622 throughout the world saints of the lord follow him and his anointed leaders they have learned that the path of dissent leads to real dangers the book of mormon carries this warning now these dissenters having the same instruction and the same information having been instructed in the same knowledge of the lord nevertheless it is strange to relate not long after their dissensions they became more hardened and impenitent and more wild wicked and ferocious giving way to indolence and all manner of lasciviousness yea entirely forgetting the lord their god alma 4736 how divisive is the force of dissension small acts can lead to such great consequences regardless of position or situation no one can safely assume immunity to contentions terrible toll thomas b marsh once one of the twelve left the church his spiritual slide to apostasy started because his wife and another woman had quarreled over a little cream after an absence from the church of nearly nineteen years he came back to a congregation of saints he then said if there are any among this people who should ever apostatize and do as i have done prepare your backs for a good whipping if you are such as the lord loves but if you will take my advice you will stand by the authorities journal of discourses 5206 see also gordon b hinckley ensign may 1984 pp 8183 of course the authorities are human but to them god has entrusted the keys to his divine work and he holds us accountable for our responses to the teachings of his servants these are the words of the lord if my people will hearken unto my voice and unto the voice of my servants whom i have appointed to lead my people behold verily i say unto you they shall not be moved out of their place but if they will not hearken to my voice nor unto the voice of these men whom i have appointed they shall not be blest dc 1244546 divine doctrine divine doctrine of the church is the prime target of attack by the spiritually contentious well do i remember a friend who would routinely sow seeds of contention in church classes his assaults would invariably be preceded by this predictable comment let me play the role of devils advocate recently he passed away one day he will stand before the lord in judgment then i wonder will my friends predictable comment again be repeated such contentious spirits are not new in an epistle to timothy the apostle paul gave this warning that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed 1 tim 61 if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to his doctrine doting about questions and strifes of words supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself 1 tim 635 see also isa 2921 2 ne 2732 dc 1930 dc 3841 dc 6014 dissecting doctrine in a controversial way in order to draw attention to oneself is not pleasing to the lord he declared bring to light the true points of my doctrine yea and the only doctrine which is in me and this i do that i may establish my gospel that there may not be so much contention yea satan doth stir up the hearts of the people to contention concerning the points of my doctrine and in these things they do err for they do wrest the scriptures and do not understand them dc 106263 contention fosters disunity the book of mormon teaches the better way alma having authority from god commanded them that there should be no contention one with another but that they should look forward with one eye having one faith and one baptism having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another mosiah 1818 21 see also mosiah 2315 steps to supplant contention what can we do to combat this canker of contention what steps may each of us take to supplant the spirit of contention with a spirit of personal peace to begin show compassionate concern for others control the tongue the pen and the word processor whenever tempted to dispute remember this proverb he that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour but a man of understanding holdeth his peace prov 1112 see also prov 1728 bridle the passion to speak or write contentiously for personal gain or glory the apostle paul thus counseled the philippians let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves philip 23 such high mutual regard would then let us respectfully disagree without being disagreeable but the ultimate step lies beyond beginning control of expression personal peace is reached when one in humble submissiveness truly loves god heed carefully this scripture there was no contention in the land because of the love of god which did dwell in the hearts of the people 4 ne 115 see also 4 ne 12 italics added thus love of god should be our aim it is the first commandmentthe foundation of faith as we develop love of god and christ love of family and neighbor will naturally follow then will we eagerly emulate jesus he healed he comforted he taught blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god matt 59 see also 3 ne 129 through love of god the pain caused by the fiery canker of contention will be extinguished from the soul this healing begins with a personal vow let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me let there be peace on earth sy miller and jill jackson janlee music beverly hills calif 1972 this commitment will then spread to family and friends and will bring peace to neighborhoods and nations shun contention seek godliness be enlightened by eternal truth be likeminded with the lord in love and united with him in faith then shall the peace of god which passeth all understanding philip 47 be yours to bless you and your posterity through generations yet to come i so testify in the name of jesus christ amen
