seeds of renewal by elder joseph b wirthlin of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder joseph b wirthlin my beloved brethren and sisters we have been inspired by this outstanding and meaningful message of our prophet seer and revelator in addition this beautiful singing of our young people has been enjoyed by all of us in a hot dry desert area of northwest mexico farmers plant seeds and grow varieties of corn and beans that are unusually hardy and drought resistant these varieties survive and flourish in a harsh climate where other plants would wither and die one of these plants is the white tepary bean its seed will sprout and the plant will grow even when very little rain falls it sends its roots as deep as six feet into the rocky sandy earth to find the moisture it needs it can flower and fruit in the 115degree fahrenheit desert temperatures with only one yearly rainfall its foliage remains remarkably green with little irrigation even in the heat of midjuly see gary paul nabhan seeds of renewal world monitor jan 1989 pp 1720 perhaps members of the church could emulate the example of these hardy sturdy plants we should send our roots deep into the soil of the gospel we should grow flourish flower and bear good fruit in abundance despite the evil temptation or criticism we might encounter we should learn to thrive in the heat of adversity our pioneer ancestors survived and grew stronger in the face of extreme trials and afflictions and made the desert blossom as a rose my own greatgrandfather suffered so much from asthma that he had to walk a mile or two behind the covered wagons crossing the plains to avoid the dust however he always arrived at his destination and did his share of the work our challenges today are different from those of our ancestors many of them lived lives of poverty and hardship some among us however are affluent and complacent wealth abundance and easy living do not help us develop the ability to flourish when faced with the rigors and reversals of life rather than seeking ease we must plant cultivate and nourish within ourselves the seeds that will enable us to withstand the winds and heat of temptation sin and evil and that will help us live successful happy and pure lives let us consider a few such seeds first we should plant and nurture the seed of faith in the lord jesus christ our savior and redeemer we each should develop the faith of nephi to do the things the lord has commanded see 1 ne 37 knowing that all commandments are given for our good nephi expressed his faith in these words if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of god he doth nourish them and strengthen them and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them 1 ne 173 when the lord instructed him to build a ship his brothers called him a fool to think he could do it he told them if god had commanded me to do all things i could do them if he should command me that i should say unto this water be thou earth it should be earth 1 ne 1750 next let us nurture the seed of faith which gives us the courage to follow the prophets todays prophet president ezra taft benson is the lords spokesman to mankind at this time we need the wisdom and the courage to accept his inspired counsel with gratitude and conform our lives to it because whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same dc 138 the revelation given to president bensons first predecessor joseph smith on the day the church was organized applies to church members today the church shalt give heed unto all his the prophets words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them for his word shall ye receive as if from mine own mouth in all patience and faith dc 2145 i am sure the lord is pleased with the response of church members to president bensons emphasis on reading and sharing the book of mormon in 1988 more than 35 million copies were purchased by far the most in any year to date perhaps more important tens of thousands of our members are reading that book more than ever before next we should sow within our hearts the seed of charity the pure love of christ he is the perfect model of charity his total life particularly his atoning sacrifice is a lesson in charity his every act reflects absolute unequivocal love for all mankind and for each one of us his example teaches us that charity means subordinating personal interests willingly and gladly for the good of others i believe our progress toward exaltation and eternal life depends upon how well we learn and live the principle of charity charity must become a fundamental state of mind and heart that guides us in all we do we urge you home teachers and visiting teachers to look after your families in a spirit of charity home teaching and visiting teaching are vehicles for saving souls when done the right way with the right intent next i believe we must constantly nourish the seeds of love harmony and unity in our homes and families fathers are to preside over their families in kindness remembering that no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood only by persuasion by longsuffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned dc 12141 husbands and wives are to love each other with a pure love that transcends selfishness in a singleparent family the parent presides parents are to nurture their children and teach them the principles of right living regardless of the help other individuals or institutions may give the lord has placed this responsibility ultimately with parents children are to honor their parents see ex 2012 by obeying them living as they are taught and fostering peace in the home parents should plant deeply the seed of the work ethic into the hearts and habits of their children as society has shifted from an agrarian to an urban structure the joy and necessity of diligent hard work have been neglected if our young people do not learn to work while in their homes they likely will be compelled to learn later in a setting where the lesson may be painful the remarks of president j reuben clark jr given fiftysix years ago are instructive today he said it is the eternal inescapable law that growth comes only from work and preparation whether the growth be material mental or spiritual work has no substitute in conference report apr 1933 p 103 more recently elder howard w hunter counseled the first recorded instruction given to adam after the fall dealt with the eternal principle of work the lord said in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread gen 319 our heavenly father loves us so completely that he has given us a commandment to work this is one of the keys to eternal life he knows that we will learn more grow more achieve more serve more and benefit more from a life of industry than from a life of ease ensign nov 1975 p 122 parents can plant seeds in the hearts and minds of their children only if they know where the children are and what they are doing parents should not leave the teaching of their children to chance they should be in charge of their homes and families remembering that reproof gives wisdom but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame prov 2915 i have heard of parents who travel extensively for pleasure leaving their teenage children without parental protection for extended periods unprotected teenagers can indulge in a little sin without realizing the possible consequences in sorrow and disappointment too many of our young people have the idea that limited sin is not really wrong because it will be forgiven easily with no consequences we see young people who are guilty of moral sins but are not overly concerned because they expect to repent quickly thinking all is well the idea that any sin is unimportant is false it comes from the devil the lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance dc 131 we should heed the counsel of nephi when he wrote many shall say eat drink and be merry nevertheless fear godhe will justify in committing a little sin there is no harm in this and if it so be that we are guilty god will beat us with a few stripes and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of god and thus the devil cheateth their souls and leadeth them away carefully down to hell 2 ne 288 21 we ask our young people who will be approaching marriage within a few years to think of their own unborn children think of what these spirits would ask you to do in your life if they could speak to you now parents must know what their children are watching on television and must protect them from its evil influence they should set a proper example by watching only those programs that are uplifting and worthwhile and opposing those that are corrupt and degrading many people decry television shows that portray sin and evil as being normal and acceptable and even preferable to righteous living however viewers set the standards for television broadcasting the networks and stations broadcast the types of programs that most of the people want to see mr frank stanton cbs president emeritus told a brigham young university audience that network television standards will continue to decline because they are based on societys standards he said standards come from the audience the audience determines the programming and program content further he said i believe there will be more infractions with respect to immorality and violence and it will get a lot worse before it gets better because of the changing standards of our society the daily universe 2 feb 1989 p 1 what a sad commentary on our society again we can learn a great principle from the book of mormon when king mosiah proposed that judges should rule instead of kings he said it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right and if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity then is the time that the judgments of god will come upon you mosiah 292627 that time of iniquity came about sixty years later and at several other times in the book of helaman we read that they who chose evil were more numerous than they who chose good hel 52 if television viewing choices serve as a valid measure of our society they who choose evil surely are more numerous than they who choose good finally i suggest that we plant in our hearts the seed of testimony a firm unwavering conviction of the truth and divinity of the gospel that we can share freely with power and persuasion humble fervent testimonies borne as prompted by the spirit can have farreaching effects president benson bore such a testimony in october 1959 when he visited the central baptist church in moscow russia and was asked to speak he described the event later as one of the most moving experiences of his life the church was filled with about 1500 people seeking to satisfy their spiritual hunger and thirst even though government policy discouraged religion he testified god lives i know that he lives he is our father jesus christ the redeemer of the world watches over this earth be unafraid keep his commandments love one another pray for peace and all will be well in closing he said i leave you my witness as a church servant for many years that the truth will endure time is on the side of truth god bless you and keep you all the days of your life those present were touched deeply many wept openly including a cynical newsman and a young russian interpreter the congregation began singing god be with you till we meet again they waved their handkerchiefs in joyous gratitude and in farewell as he and those with him left the meeting see ezra taft benson cross fire the eight years with eisenhower garden city ny doubleday and co inc 1962 pp 48588 president bensons testimony made a deep and lasting impression on a minister of that church father alexander a few years later this minister told a finnish member of our church sister irma airto that of all the notable people who visited the baptist church and signed the guest register ezra taft benson was the greatest president benson was visiting russia as a high official in the united states government but father alexander recognized him as a great spiritual leader father alexander told sister airto when you meet mr benson tell him that we know he is a man of god and i pray for him sister airto never expected to meet president benson in person to convey this message however when he visited finland and created the helsinki finland stake in october 1977 she was able to deliver the message strengthening her testimony that the lord guides our affairs another example of the farreaching effects of an inspired testimony is that of the prophet abinadi the testimony he bore as he called an apostate king noah and his priests to repentance is one of the most significant doctrinal discourses in the book of mormon the king and his priests except one rejected abinadis teachings and had him put to death that one was alma abinadi may have felt that he failed as a missionary because he had only one convert so far as the record shows however that one convert alma and his descendants were spiritual leaders among the nephites and lamanites for about three hundred years his son alma became the first chief judge of the nephite people and the high priest over the church almas other descendants who became prominent religious leaders include his grandson helaman greatgrandson helaman greatgreatgrandson nephi and greatgreatgreatgrandson nephi who was the chief disciple of the resurrected jesus christ all of this resulted from abinadis lone convert see mosiah 18 and daniel h ludlow a companion to your study of the book of mormon salt lake city deseret book co 1976 p 187 my brothers and sisters i bear my testimony that we can plant in our hearts and minds the seeds i have mentioned and others if we will plant them and nurture them we can be true faithful and happy regardless of adversity and the buffetings of satan i testify further that i know our heavenly father loves each of his children that jesus christ is our lord and savior and redeemer that joseph smith is the prophet of the restoration and that president ezra taft benson is the prophet today in the name of jesus christ amen
