our kindred familyexpression of eternal love by elder j richard clarke of the presidency of the seventy imageelder j richard clarke my brothers and sisters since last october it has been my blessing to be associated with the family history department of the church it enables each of us to experience the joy of the covenants and the ordinances of the temple as we make them available to our loved ones famous roots author alex haley once said in all of us there is a hunger marrowdeep to know our heritageto know who we are and where we have come from without this enriching knowledge there is a hollow yearning no matter what our attainments in life there is still an emptiness and the most disquieting loneliness through family history we discover the most beautiful tree in the forest of creationour family tree its numerous roots reach back through history and its branches extend throughout eternity family history is the expansive expression of eternal love it is born of selflessness it provides opportunity to secure the family unit forever moroni told young joseph smith that elijah the prophet would come and reveal anew the purposes powers and blessings of the holy priesthood which had been lost to the world through the keys he would restore promises made earlier to the fathers would be planted in the hearts of their latterday children our hearts would then turn to our fathers and through this impelling promise the sacred relationships of mortality could be extended forever families of the earth could become families of heaven dr krister stendahl bishop of the lutheran church in stockholm expressed this profound sentiment about our temple in sweden isnt it wonderful he said only the mormons are extending the blessings of the atonement of jesus christ to those beyond the grave he is right the blessings of the atonement do extend beyond the grave jesus suffered and died to preserve and unify our fathers family in earliest biblical culture the family was more than a parent and child unit it included all who were related by blood and marriage this kindred family as i prefer to call it was strongly linked by natural affection and the patriarchal priesthood the elderly were venerated for their experience and wisdom there were strength and safety in numbers and through love and support members established solidarity and continuity many social and economic conditions in todays world militate against such a kindred family throughout the ages evil forces have attacked the family why do you suppose satan is so obsessed with its dissolution because it stands for everything he wants and cannot have he cannot be a husband a father or a grandfather he cannot have posterity now or ever satan cannot even keep those he has led away from god he has no eternal kingdom or inheritance nevertheless the family is societys strongest and most important institution where it has survived it has done so as a matter of highest priority individual interests have been subordinated to the interests of the group sacrifice has exceeded selfishness loyalty respect for the family name pride in one anothers achievements and shared quality time have been preeminent i had the good fortune of marrying into such a family i have marveled as relatives have traveled great distances to support a family activity a missionary farewell or a wedding an elderly aunt still invites cousins of four generations who are attending brigham young university into her home for family home evenings through this association the cousins strengthen each other in keeping the covenants of the gospel if the kindred family system were working as it could our hearts would encompass each family member in time of need shared resources would make the family selfreliant children would consider it a blessing not a burden to care for aged parents i know of a widowed father who was reluctant to live with his daughter who resided in another state she thanked him for the privilege of taking him into her home insisting that she now would be able to demonstrate her love for all she had received from her parents she felt selfish in finally having him to herself upon his death she told me how blessed she was to have had those last precious years with her father the priesthood is the vital power which solidifies the kindred family one of the most sacred privileges of fatherhood is the blessing of ones children many years ago in this tabernacle i heard elder sterling sill recognize the men who had performed the essential priesthood ordinances listed on his membership record i suddenly realized that my fathers name did not appear on my record he had not been active in the church while i was growing up but had since become a faithful high priest returning home from conference i brooded about this feeling deprived i telephoned my father and said dad id like to ask you a favor you can do something for me that no other living person can do i would like a fathers blessing he hesitated and said well well see the next time you come to rexburg i persisted to my knowledge he had never given a fathers blessing before and he was nervous at the age of eightyfour he placed his quivering hands upon my head and this son will never forget the supreme joy of hearing a proud father pour out his heart in a blessinga blessing which will be held sacred and cherished not because of its eloquence but because it came from my father i hope brethren that you will not deny your children this choice experience now i realize there are numerous singleparent families in the church who do not have a priesthood bearer to preside in the home and bless them they are reluctant to impose on others and are frequently offended by insensitive remarks regarding their family status this is also true of single adults who have yet to marry they often feel cut off from the mainstream of mormon family life they especially need to be part of a gospel kindred family where blessings can be obtained from worthy priesthood bearers and role models can be found in quorum brotherhood and relief society sisterhood families in the ward can reach out and share loving concern within the lords design no one should be ignored we are all members of the body of christ as we learn to be loving caring families in mortality our hearts will naturally turn to members of our kindred family in the spirit world as they continue to live beyond the veil they waitthey wait for us their family to share the blessings of the ordinances of the priesthood they yearn to belong to the eternal family circle they are anxious for us to make this possible are we not compelled to do so i was impressed by the testimony of a single adult in washington dc who as a recent convert found herself suddenly immersed in the pursuit of her family history after her first sacred experience of participating in the temple ordinance work for several of her kindred family she expressed her feelings with tears of joy now she exclaimed i am no longer the only member of the church in my family our family research and temple ordinances make it possible for us to be forever families the process of compiling family history records need not be expensive or complicated we may not be able to do everything but we can do something with her permission i would like to share part of a sweet letter i received from sister linda seamon of the flagstaff arizona stake we are a young family my husband and i are 33 we have three small children this is a busy family time for us in our lives for months diana our ward genealogy person would call us on a regular basis to ask if there was anything she could do to help us get started on our family history we of course thanked her for the call but firmly replied that aunt leona cousin nellie and aunt bertha have done all there is to do on our families then intrigued by an article in the ensign about the new 85 x 11 forms for family history i mentioned this to diana and a week later she was at my door with the forms i took a look and thought how neat it would be to fill in the forms with our own names in the blanks this simple experience of a loving persistent family history representative was what got us started we both come from mormon families several generations back we thought the ordinance work for our ancestors had been completed we were wrong in the short months we have been collecting copies of family group records we have had so many experiences that confirmed to us the lords hand in this work 44 baptisms 45 endowments 29 children sealed to parents 16 marriage sealings all of these from records that were supposedly all done words cannot express the joy we have felt in the temple performing ordinances for our ancestors family relationships some estranged since childhood have been healed our extended families have also become involved we have sent names to five different temples so that we could be united in helping to complete the temple work we believe that it takes just one temple experience for ones ancestors to convince a person of the importance of this work it is possible to become involved in this exciting work at any age were committed to it the prophet joseph smith gave us this sober warning the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link between the fathers and the children for we without them cannot be made perfect neither can they without us be made perfect dc 12818 in the councils of heaven before the world began we made a solemn agreement with the lord to assist in bringing to pass the eternal life of man elder john a widtsoe reminds us that the least of us the humblest is in partnership with the almighty in achieving the purpose of the eternal plan of salvation it is mans duty his pleasure and joy his labor and ultimately his glory by that doctrine with the lord at the head we become saviors on mount zion i bear witness that this work is true i testify that we may anticipate a glorious reunion with our kindred family through the covenant blessings of the priesthood i pray that we will heed the prophets and inherit the supreme joy which comes from performing this marvelous work of salvation in the name of jesus christ amen
