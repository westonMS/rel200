their support for each of us on their behalf i extend their gratitude and love to all of you i deeply appreciate the invocation and the messages delivered by the general presidency of the relief society and by this wonderful womens chorus sister doxey has recounted the privilege that each of us has to strengthen the familythe basic component of society and the fundamental unit of the church the family is provided in gods plan to nurture his children and prepare them to return to himas families sister evans has helped us understand that the human race doesnt run on a smooth track the route more closely resembles an obstacle course with hurdles puddles or snares lurking around every turn we make life isnt meant to be easy the race isnt to be won by the swift or the flashy victory comes only to those who muster the faith to stay on the trackthe strait and narrow way sister winder has put our purpose in perspective she has taught an eternal truthmen are that they might have joy 2 ne 225 and she has emphasized one of the means by which true joy is realized rendering selfless service of worth to others as the male participant tonight i bear a great responsibility to convey deep feelings of gratitude for the men of the church i say thank you not only do i express gratitude but our affection as well represented in this vast audience are our dear companions our mothers our sisters our daughters and our granddaughters we respect and honor you we support your wonderful efforts we are grateful to receive the benefit of your counsel and insights in challenges we share as partners and we thank you as mothers or potential mothers for your partnership with god in providing life without women the whole purpose of the creation of this world would be in vain this truth we learn from scriptures about the priesthood the creation adam and eve before the world was formed the lord jesus christ was jehovah the great i am the beginning and the end who looked upon the wide expanse of eternity and all the seraphic hosts of heaven dc 381 see also dc 291 dc 391 he told abraham having first shown him the intelligences that were organized before the world was among all these there were many of the noble and great ones and god saw these souls that they were good and he stood in the midst of them and he said these i will make my rulers abr 32223 the lord then revealed that abraham was one of them chosen and foreordained before he was born scriptural verse then continues there stood one among them that was like unto god and he said unto those who were with him we will go down and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell abr 324 then the gods organized and formed the heavens and the earth abr 41 you will recall that after the earth had been created divided beautified and inhabited with plant and animal life the crowning achievement of the creation was to be manthe human being so the gods went down to organize man in their own image male and female to form they them abr 427 see also gen 126 the very purpose of creation was to provide bodies to enable these eagerly awaiting spirits to enjoy mortal life and experiences question what was the role of the priesthood in the process of creation the prophet joseph smith taught the priesthood is an everlasting principle and existed with god from eternity christ is the great high priest adam next teachings of the prophet joseph smith sel joseph fielding smith salt lake city deseret book co 1938 pp 15758 the priesthood was first given to adam he obtained the first presidency and held the keys of it from generation to generation he obtained it in the creation before the world was formed teachings p 157 president brigham young said priesthood is the law by which the worlds are were and will continue for ever and ever discourses of brigham young sel john a widtsoe salt lake city deseret book co 1941 p 130 thus priesthood is the power of god its ordinances and covenants are to bless men and women alike by that power the earth was created under the direction of the father jehovah was the creator as michael adam did his part he became the first man but in spite of the power and glory of creation to that point the final link in the chain of creation was still missing all the purposes of the world and all that was in the world would be brought to naught without womana keystone in the priesthood arch of creation when eve was createdwhen her body was made by godadam exclaimed bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man moses 323 from the rib of adam eve was formed see gen 222 moses 322 abr 516 interesting to me is the fact that animals fashioned by our creator such as dogs and cats have thirteen pairs of ribs but the human being has one less with only twelve i presume another bone could have been used but the rib coming as it does from the side seems to denote partnership the rib signifies neither dominion nor subservience but a lateral relationship as partners to work and to live side by side adam and eve were joined together in marriage for time and for all eternity by the power of that everlasting priesthood see gen 22425 moses 325 abr 51819 eve came as a partner to build and to organize the bodies of mortal men she was designed by deity to cocreate and nurture life that the great plan of the father might achieve fruition eve was the mother of all living moses 426 she was the first of all women from our study of eve we may learn five fundamental lessons of everlasting importance she labored beside her companion see moses 51 she and adam bore the responsibilities of parenthood see moses 52 she and her partner worshipped the lord in prayer see moses 54 she and adam heeded divine commandments of obedience and sacrifice see moses 55 6 she and her husband taught the gospel to their children see moses 512 from these five fundamental lessons we can study patterns which apply to presentday circumstances let us review them lesson by lesson she labored beside her companion adam held the priesthood eve served in matriarchal partnership with the patriarchal priesthood so today each wife may join with her husband as a partner unified in purpose scriptures state clearly neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord 1 cor 1111 they twain shall be one flesh matt 196 mark 108 dc 4916 marvelously it takes a man and a woman to make a man or a woman without union of the sexes neither can we exist nor can we become perfect ordinary and imperfect people can build each other through their wholeness together the complete contribution of one partner to the other is essential to exaltation this is so that the earth might answer the end of its creation dc 4916 so labor and love in partnership honor your companion any sense of competition for place or position is not appropriate for either partner especially when enlightened by scriptural understanding as adam bore responsibilities of fatherhood so eve bore the responsibilities of motherhood she did not shirk them so with welcome arms you may gratefully greet those children god may send through your divine design as cocreator with your husband be obedient to the commandment to multiply and replenish the earth as your opportunity your spiritual guidance your wisdom and your health allow you will gain joy and rejoicing in your posterity that enrichment becomes more beautiful and precious with each passing year for you childless sisters and those without companions remember the eternal timetable of the lord is much longer than the lonely hours of your preparation or the total of this mortal life these are only as microseconds when compared to eternity your willingness and worthiness are surely known to him the spiritual rewards of motherhood are available to all women nurturing the young comforting the frightened protecting the vulnerable teaching and giving encouragement need notand should notbe limited to our own children sisters be patient i know something of the pressures you feel your kitchens are too small your budgets are too tight demands upon you exceed your capacity to help all who cry out to you through it all improve the shining moments dont let them pass you by hymns 1985 no 226 take time for spiritual regeneration ill share a few lines that have sustained sister nelson through the years they also reflect her sense of priority cleaning and scrubbing can wait til tomorrow for babies grow up weve learned to our sorrow so quiet down cobwebs dust go to sleep im rocking my baby and babies dont keep im glad sister nelson has not tried to be a supermom but she has been a soothing mom this she has done simply by being herself when priorities are in place one can more patiently tolerate unfinished business time flies on wings of lightning we cannot call it back hymns 1985 no 226 and while it passes remember the precious eternal perspective as you faithfully endure to the end you will gain rewards promised by your father in heaven they include thrones kingdoms principalities powers dominions glory immortality and eternal lives see dc 755 dc 12812 13 dc 13219 24 moses 139 eve and her partner worshipped the lord in prayer as adam and eve called upon the name of the lord moses 54 a precedent was established as each of us follows that pattern of prayer blessings of wisdom and personal peace will ensue counsel with the lord in all thy doings and he will direct thee for good alma 3737 pray alone in your closetin the solitude of your own sanctuary pour out the longings of your soul then pray with and for your husband your sons and daughters your sister and brother your mother and father and all in your family let the weight of your innocence be felt as you lovingly motivate others to good works with your mind so attuned to the lord and his power your influence for good becomes immeasurably great and in this world of sin and temptation the power of prayer will protect you and be a shield for your loved ones i plead with the women of the church to accept individual responsibility to know and to love the lord communicate with him he will impress upon your mind inspiration and personal revelation to give you strength eve and her husband heeded divine commandments of obedience and sacrifice they received commandments that they should worship the lord their god and should offer an offering unto the lord moses 55 this direction to worship and sacrifice was obeyed by adam and eve later they learned that this was a similitude of the sacrifice of the only begotten of the father which is full of grace and truth moses 57 when christ came to the earth he fulfilled the promised role as he became the ultimate sacrificial lamb his atonement brought about a greater destiny and a nobler concept for us we are still commanded to sacrifice but not by shedding blood of animals our highest sense of sacrifice is achieved as we make ourselves more sacred or holy this we do by our obedience to the commandments of god thus the laws of obedience and sacrifice are indelibly intertwined consider the commandments to obey the word of wisdom to keep the sabbath day holy to pay an honest tithe as we comply with these and other commandments something wonderful happens to us we become disciplined we become disciples we become more sacred and holylike our lord i pay tribute to beloved ladies in my life who have taught sanctifying lessons to me for a short time during the first year of our marriage sister nelson maintained two jobs while i was in medical school before her paychecks had arrived we found ourselves owing more than our funds could defray so we took advantage of an option then available to sell blood at 25 a pint in an interval between her daytime job as a schoolteacher and her evening work as a clerk in a music store we went to the hospital and each sold a pint of blood as the needle was withdrawn from her arm she said to me dont forget to pay tithing on my blood money when her mother learned i was bleeding her daughter between two jobs i sensed at that time she may not have been too pleased with her new soninlaw such obedience was a tremendous lesson to me sister nelsons commitment to tithe became my commitment too you righteous daughters never underestimate the influence for good you can exert upon your fathers i havent met a father yet who claimed to be perfect so in his imperfection stand steadfast in loving patience with your dad let me illustrate this point with a personal story many years ago when our daughters were very young sister nelson and i took them fishing we were having a wonderful time everyone was catching fish then shades of saturday nights darkness brought a curfew to our fun so great was my enthusiasm for our success i allowed myself to rationalize aloud with the girls rationalization is one of the real obstacles to obedience knowing that the next day was sunday i jokingly said if we get up tomorrow two hours earlier than normal we could catch some more fish and then quit promptly at our usual wakeup hour silence followed my companion and our daughters all glared at me icy stillness was broken when our sevenyearold said daddy would you eat those fish you caught on sunday then she added would you ask heavenly father to bless fish you caught on the sabbath needless to say we did no fishing the next morning their commitment to the sabbath became my commitment too so it is dear daughters as you obey each of gods commandments your holiness will fortify the foundation of your fathers faith when the two of you are together spiritually one plus one is clearly greater than two adam and eve taught the gospel to their children today men and women still have that worthy work to do but before you can teach you must first learn of your premortal existence the creation the fall the atonement of christ and the reason for mortality study the scriptures and internalize them teach faith repentance baptism and the gift of the holy ghost then let your commitment to the mission of the church be evident in all you do preaching the gospel perfecting the saints and redeeming members of your family will cause you to concentrate on covenants and ordinances of eternal significance as you exercise your agency teach things that are elevating and useful teach the principles of honesty selfreliance avoidance of unnecessary debt you will build a more stable society by so doing and remember your example what you are is more important than what you do or what you say we cant all do all things circumstances available time and talents vary widely among us your diversities take you to numerous arenas of activity there let your presence be felt your foes in a sordid society demean the sacredness of women and the sanctity of motherhood your world sickened by unchastity and plagued with sexually transmitted disease needs your righteous example for the wrath of god is provoked by governments that sponsor gambling condone pornography or legalize abortion these forces serve to denigrate women now just as they did in the days of sodom and gomorrah you canyou mustmake a difference you are vital to the lords teamone team with one purpose through your diversity build strength in unity bind yourselves together in all holiness anchor yourselves to the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone eph 220 as sister winder mentioned the funeral service for sister camilla kimball was held earlier today magnificent and welldeserved tributes were paid to her we can learn from her great example of courage let us emulate her faith and likewise heed this teaching from the book of mormon which gave her such strength and security remember that it is upon the rock of our redeemer who is christ the son of god that ye must build your foundation that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds yea his shafts in the whirlwind yea when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo because of the rock upon which ye are built which is a sure foundation a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall hel 512 beloved sisters let your lives be committed to your father in heaven to his only begotten son and to his church restored by them in this latter day i testify that it is true and that president benson is the prophet on earth today a dispensation of the gospel has been entrusted to our care everlasting priesthood principles laws and powers depend upon our partnership i invoke the blessings of almighty god upon you that you may be successful in fulfilling your divine destiny in the name of jesus christ amen
