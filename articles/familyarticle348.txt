developing faith by elder a theodore tuttle of the first quorum of the seventy imageelder a theodore tuttle my beloved brothers and sisters i would be ungrateful if i did not thank the many of you who have prayed for my wellbeing over the past few months medical science is marvelous but above and beyond that it takes special blessings from our heavenly father for healing to occur i appreciate your prayers in my behalf i was told of a conversation by a primary teacher who related what transpired in his class he was teaching the elevenyearolds he asked the question suppose the lord asked you to build a spaceship big enough to take you and your family and provisions off this planet could you do it steve spoke up and said yes and the teacher said have you ever built a spaceship no have you ever built a model spaceship no have you ever seen one steve said yes on tv but then he declared you said the lord told me to build it if the lord told me to build it i could do it i wonder how many of us as adults have that kind of faith i would like to read in the book of mormon a great example of this kind of faith i go to the seventeenth chapter of 1 nephi and it came to pass that the lord spake unto me nephi saying thou shalt construct a ship after the manner which i shall show thee that i may carry thy people across these waters 1 ne 178 listen to the answer of this great nephi and i said lord whither shall i go that i may find ore to molten that i may make tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me 1 ne 179 and when his brothers realized that he was actually going to set about to build a ship they said why youre a fool you dont know how to construct a ship see 1 ne 1717 and then nephi set about to teach them a great lesson how do you develop faith lets learn a great lesson from what transpired with nephi he started to recount the things that had happened that they all knew were a part of their heritage he went back to the coming of the children of israel out of egypt he said you know what happened there they were right against the red sea with the egyptians coming and the lord saved them see 1 ne 172627 then he goes on and talks about how they received manna in the wilderness how they received water from a rock how the lord led them by a pillar of cloud in the daytime and a light at night and how when they crossed the jordan it stopped when the feet of the priests touched the water see 1 ne 172830 32 see also ex 1321 josh 31517 and then nephi tells how the lord scattered the people and then how when they came among the flying serpents moses fashioned a brazen serpent raised it and all they had to do was look at that serpent and they would be healed the account says that many perished because they wouldnt even look see 1 ne 1732 41 see also num 2189 he was trying to do what you and i as parents need to do with our families todayto develop faith in the lord and the way to do it is to recount the examples of faith that have happened in our history and in our heritage and with our people thats the value of history it contains accounts of faith of our own blood and ancestry and of our own people and our children as has already been said in this conference we cannot go one generation without losing faith if we do not do this and to rear a generation of faith for what we must do in these days you and i simply must develop and increase faith in the lord jesus christ theres another principle that is that faith precedes the miracle this lesson is found in ether chapter 12 youll recall that moroni was abridging the records of the twentyfour plates and this is what he records and it came to pass that ether did prophesy great and marvelous things unto the people which they did not believe because they saw them not ether 125 they couldnt see them they wouldnt believe them they needed to be taught that believing is seeing and then moroni interpolates here and now i moroni would speak somewhat concerning these things i would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen wherefore dispute not because ye see not for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith ether 126 italics added we need to learn that we cant have just faith we cannot have the miracle until after the exercise of faith moroni sets forth on the next page or so instances of those miracles that have occurred after the trial of the faith of the people we need to learn that principle as well i recall that when i was twenty years old i went for an interview with the bishop to go on a mission when i returned my mother all smiles said well ted what did the bishop say he said i couldnt go why not my mother asked and i said because we dont have enough money if my father could leave two children and another to be born shortly after he left you can go i said i know that but the bishop doesnt parenthetically i might say that he was doing his job right he asked me if i had any money i told him i had a few hundred dollars that i had earned that summer he said then what i said my dad would send it to me he said does your dad have it i said no and he didnt we had lost our sheep herd during the depression my father was a livestock dealer buying lambs and wool on commission and that was a very uncertain income the bishop said the brethren have had some serious experiences and so you cannot go unless you can guarantee that youll have sufficient money i accepted that and thats what i told my mother that night we waited for dad to come home and then held a family council we concluded that we didnt then have enough moneyand that we wouldnt so far as we could see anytime in the future we decided to ask our neighbor tom anderson a rather wealthy man if he would help when we explained our situation he said you tell the bishop that i will back you before the bishop opened his business the next morning i was there waiting to tell him that tom anderson said he would back me the bishop said thats all i need to know the interesting thing was that we never did have to call on brother anderson my folks would send that check and with it a note this is for this month and well have the next months too i am a product of a household of faith i learned faith in my home i was taught it it was drilled into me i need that faith now as much as i ever did i think we all do were not going to survive in this world temporally or spiritually without increased faith in the lordand i dont mean a positive mental attitudei mean downright solid faith in the lord jesus christ that is the one thing that gives vitality and power to otherwise rather weak individuals i bear you my humble witness that i know that god lives i know that he lives that he is our father that he loves us i bear witness that jesus is the christ our savior and our redeemer i understand better what that means now i am grateful for his atonement in our behalf and for knowing something about our relationship to him and to our heavenly father and about the meaning and purpose of the gospel of jesus christ i am grateful for joseph smith i know he was a prophet and i know that president ezra taft benson is a living prophet today i bear that witness in the name of jesus christ amen
