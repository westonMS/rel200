you and i love you in these early months of our presidency we have felt your faith your strength and your prayers know that you have our faith our commitment to serve you and our prayers as you stand strong in doing what is right to youmaria anne alofa kristen michelle every one of you in every corner of the earth in every family every classroom wherever you arewho are striving for righteousness join with a quarter of a million other young women in becoming a mighty force for good you can bring light where there is darkness hope where there is despair and faith where there is doubt but it wont be easy i know that you know it too i believe it may be as hard maybe even harder than the struggles of our young pioneer sisters who pushed handcarts suffered extreme fatigue or were deserted by family or loved ones when they joined the church an account from my greatgrandmothers journal gives this example almost a century and a half ago the book of mormon was brought into the home of susan kent when she was sixteen years of age after studying the book of mormon susan gained a testimony of the truth of the book that was so strong she could not reject it although to accept it meant a great sacrifice for her she was at the time engaged to a young man and felt she could not endure being separated from him but he would have nothing to do with anyone who would join the mormons she did not count the cost she chose the path of peace for her conscience but her heart was so grieved that she could partake of no nourishment for several days then she lapsed into a coma so profound it had the appearance of actual death preparations were being made for her funeral until she awoke one day asking how long have i slept with tender care she slowly regained her health and with her sister abigail and their parents joined the church louisa lula greene diary historical department the church of jesus christ of latterday saints salt lake city ill be eternally thankful to my greatgrandmother susan kent for her testimony of the book of mormon and what it meant in her life and now what it means in mine each of you will have a different and difficult kind of experience but nevertheless an experience of personal sacrifice your challenges will require moral courage to mark a straight and narrow path for others to follow your challenges might be similar to susans you might have to break an engagement or decline an invitation to a dance or a party because you have chosen to follow the teachings of the book of mormon and our modernday prophet this is a time when the influence of many movies and fashions and music and fads would try to desensitize you so that the greatest and most dangerous hazards appear not so bad and the loud voices of the world would be allowed to interfere with the whisperings of the spirit within you and thus threaten your eternal life this very week a young girl from texas was telling of her struggle to be good she spoke of the constant bombarding of evils made to appear appealing at school on the television in advertisements there is hardly a corner protected from messages of immorality you simply cant make it alone she said tonight id like to talk to you about striving together you need not travel alone in fact you must not if you are to avoid the dangerous hazards along the way when we strive together in righteousness with our families and friends there is increased safety now some families are more complete than others but every family is precious there are times when we need help from our family and dont even know it and may not even want it and it wont make much sense until later let me explain what i mean i remember one evening years ago while attending a sunday school party i looked at the clock and it was past the time i was told to be home just then a knock came on the door i was horrifiedmy dad had come after me i felt humiliated in front of my friends i thought i wanted to die i was not pleasant with my dad disobedience never makes one pleasant a few years later my friends and i were driving home from a dance across an indian reservation ten miles from any shelter it was 40 degrees below zero and the windchill continued to lower the temperature a few miles farther into the blizzard we discovered that there was no heat in the car then the car froze up and would not run we came to a slow stop we watched the snow swirling in front of us only until the windows quickly froze over we were quiet and sober as we contemplated our fateour lives were in danger the silence was broken as a friend in the backseat asked how long do you think it will be before your dad will get here why do you think they thought my dad would come one time i had thought i wanted to die because he had come after me this time we lived because my dad came through the blizzard to save my life and the lives of my friends this time i was pleasant with my dadpleasant and very grateful this life provides many causes for disunity and strife evil forces are working relentlessly to have us bring contention into our homes over any issue and threaten our happiness our peace and our love for each other some time ago a young girl came into my office there was anger in her voice and hurt in her eyes she came to tell me all the things she didnt like about her mom i listened and listened until she got it all out it was a long list there was silence then i asked is there anything good about your mom i waited i think she had refused to let her mind think in that direction until that moment i asked amy how do you feel about your mom she raised her head tears streaming down her cheeks she is my mom i love her she had discovered love now there is no magic formula she still had to go home and work it out day by day but she let go of the strife in her heart and she wanted to strive together with her mom and thats exactly what her mom had been praying for miracles can happen when we decide to work together in amys case something of a miracle did happen its okay that your parents arent perfect no ones are and its okay that they didnt have any perfect children either no ones are you see our whole purpose is to strive together in righteousness overcoming our weaknesses day by day dont ever give up on each other sometimes a daughter can rescue a parent in times of storm when she cares enough to help i know a family with a dad who has had to move from job to job in his kind of work everyone is getting laid off one day his turn came he might have come home and called his wife into the other room and said my dear we dont have enough money to pay the bills and i know how much julie wants that expensive sweater i told her we would try to get it for her i dont want to disappoint her what am i going to do there might be some teenage daughters who would have said but all of the other kids get new things we deserve it besides dad promised but that wasnt the way it happened dad came home he didnt have to say anything julie and her sister knew julie didnt say dad what are you going to do her mom told me that she put her arm around his shoulder and said oh dad we can help how do you think her dad felt do you have any idea how her mom must have felt since that time julie has been working two jobs twelve hours a day to pay for her tuition to college this fall on the day her twelveyearold brother would not be able to go to camp because he had no suitable pants to wear julie received her pay from both jobs her mom told me that she held out the money for her tithing held back the portion she must save each week for her college tuition and had enough left to take her brother shopping for the much needed pants how do you think her brother felt do you have any idea how julie must have felt disappointment and sacrifice can provide the struggles that make you pull together or become the enemy that will divide and destroy families you will decide which it will be im convinced that if you will stop like amy and think of the good things instead of the bad youll discover love that will bind you safely together with your family through all of the skirmishes that occur with loved ones like having to share the bathroom or the car or the one nice dress or whatever with loved ones who are not yet perfectstriving together through thick or thin and lest you get anxious let me remind you that perfection is hard work and comes only a step at a time president dwan young spoke so beautifully of the meaning of our baptismal covenant each sunday as we partake of the sacrament we promise again to strive to keep the commandments so the spirit of the lord will be with us always when you learn to listen to the whisperings of that spirit within you and have the courage to follow those whisperings you will become noticeably different because you wont be doing many of the things that are popular with the world that wont be easy but you can handle that let me share with you the last lines of a poem written by my sister shirley for her children listen to your inner drummer step to its quiet beat the world beats another rhythm a rhythm of defeat well become a holy people peculiar and divine living in the world but walking out of time there will continue to be strife in the world but because of the covenants the promises we have made to care about one another and the promises our father in heaven has made never to leave us or desert us we will come through the storm together to rescue each other in times of danger even as my dad came after me we will look forward with faith in god having our hearts knit together in unity and in love one toward another we can do this i know we can the evils of our day will increase even as the wicked armies of pharaoh threatened the children of israel in the time of moses but with faith in god striving together in righteousness we of all people have reason to take heart and rejoice with our eyes fixed on heaven well watch the red sea part in the name of jesus christ amen
