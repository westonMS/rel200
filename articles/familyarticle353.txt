home and family a divine eternal pattern by elder gene r cook of the first quorum of the seventy imageelder gene r cook thank you sister smith from all the sisters of the church and certainly all the brethren as well we appreciate your service and that of sister cannon some years ago a fire erupted in the middle of the night and completely destroyed a familys home a neighbor came by to console a sevenyearold not knowing that he was about to be taught a great principle johnny its sure too bad your home burned down johnny thought a moment and then said oh thats where youre mistaken mr brown that was not our home that was just our house we still have our home we just dont have any place to put it right now what a great principle taught by a child about home what does that word bring to your mindhome to some an edifice to others a place to sleep a place to eat a place where worldly goods are stored yet to others more spiritually inclined it might mean where family is where my heart is a sacred place a peaceful place an escape from a wicked world the still small voice whispers yet a deeper meaning home is heaven we are strangers here on earth my real home is not here but there my challenge is to learn how to bring about a home here on earth similar to the celestial one i left the lord said that we were taught even before we were born we received our first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men dc 13856 thus we were taught to labor in the vineyard a good part of which perhaps the most important part was to know how to labor at home we were taught by the lord by the best of all teachers perhaps therefore the relearning here on earth with our agency is to largely experience and rediscover the teachings in the flesh how might i remember and rediscover what i once knew the lord answers pray and i will make known unto you things from the foundation of the world according to your faith and holy works see alma 1230 i will bring all things back to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you see john 1426 and alma 1230 and will enlarge the memory of this people see alma 378 at times when one speaks of home and family some who are single widowed a single parent or a grandparent might be tempted to feel these teachings dont apply to them but may i remind all that when the lord sent us here for our individual growth he sent us to live with and be nurtured spiritually and temporally by a family the lord organized the whole earth this way there is no other way to enter mortality yet some still say i dont have a family im all alone may i remind you that you always were and ever will be a member of the family of god you are his son or his daughter it doesnt matter if your parents or spouse or brothers or sisters are members nonmembers living or dead they are still your family and if you are righteous and faithful to the end no matter what your present status you ultimately will be blessed as part of a family unit thus it behooves all of us to learn and live to the degree we can in our present situation the principles governing family life in preparation for exaltation whether were a parent grandparent brother sister uncle aunt or a childwhether we are single or married this is the lords pattern his expanded view of the word family thus hearken all ye families of the earth immediate and extended families yea every living soul and the lord will teach you of the sacredness of that heavenly organization called family called home brothers and sisters for just a moment please imagine yourselves as if you were in the premortal existence in that council in heaven yes even a council of the fathers own family could the father not have spoken words such as these to all of us my children my children marriage on earth will be ordained of god unto man see dc 491516 dc 13114 by divine decree you will be copartners with god in bringing children to earth see gen 122 28 2 ne 22223 dc 13263 the family unit will be the principal agency for the spiritual and temporal nurturing of the individual see mosiah 41415 dc 6825 28 the father perhaps continuing might have said when you go to earth teach your children to love the lord thy god with all thine heart see deut 657 and to love and to serve one another see mosiah 415 pray in your families both morning midday and evening and i will quicken your memory of these teachings see 3 ne 1821 alma 3421 27 dc 6828 on earth teach them repentance faith in christ baptism the gift of the holy ghost priesthood covenants and temple ordinances see dc 6825 27 dc 13219 grandparents uncles and aunts you can help consecrate your family resources to the lord be free with your substance see dc 423031 jacob 217 dc 11917 provoke not your children to wrath see eph 64 neither suffer that they fight and quarrel one with another thus sowing seeds of contention see mosiah 414 perhaps he continued saying fathers to be you will learn what true spiritual leadership is mostly at home not so much in the world mothers yours will be a sacred call unlike any other to raise these little children so that they will be like i am unless you all become as little children you will not be able to return home to me learn your duty from living prophets and from the scriptures lastly because of the sacred nature of parenthood i will personally teach you through the holy ghost those things that matter most stay close to me humbly ask for help perhaps the father continued saying my children there are also a number of cautions i would give you because the influence of the world will be so strong there will be heavy influence to maintain families small however remember as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them ps 12745 on earth remember to keep your family responsibilities as a priority there will be many who will want to encroach upon your responsibility for teaching and providing activities for your family never forget that yours is the primary responsibility and that your ultimate success in all other endeavors will be in direct proportion to the attention given these divinely appointed relationships see dc 88119 strive to be together avoid activities and those that would pull you apart remember where love runs deep so can hurt feelings and frictions as love may become frustrated see 2 ne 114 21 as children be sure to give heed to your father and mother remembering that i the lord have placed them over you honor them see ex 2012 when you go to earth children remember that once you are a parent you will always be a parent whether it be a grandparent a greatgrandparent or a parent as i am your responsibilities to preside go on through the generations to assist in turning the hearts of the children to their fathers resist the temptation to be uninvolved retiring from your family and doing your own thing as grandparents your wisdom and vision will allow you to draw together your whole family which i the lord have given you see mosiah 25 brothers and sisters perhaps he concluded my children dont be too concerned about remembering these things you will find that when these things are taught to you they will seem strangely familiar as if you always knew them you did because you experienced it all here in your heavenly home see 1 ne 158 11 you will suffer affliction with your children in allowing them to grow and develop just as i have suffered affliction with you see dc 1335253 but dont be afraid i have given mine angels charge concerning you those sent from my very presence to be round about you to bear you up see dc 8442 88 dc 13353 this is your opportunity to experience what we have taught you follow the promptings we love you brothers and sisters in conclusion may i say where possible parents whatever you are doing return home children wherever you are no matter what your failure problem or sin you will always be loved by your family go home grandparents brothers sisters uncles aunts draw your families together return home may the concept of home be exalted because the lord so organized it in the beginning i pay tribute to my grandparents to my parents especially to my wife and to my children in having made my home the best place in all the world theres no place in all the earth i would rather be than at home and lastly may the day come when these praises about home and family we will all sing o my father thou that dwellest in the high and glorious place when shall i regain thy presence and again behold thy face in the heavens are parents single no the thought makes reason stare truth is reason truth eternal tells me ive a mother there when i leave this frail existence when i lay this mortal by father mother may i meet you in your royal courts on high then at length when ive completed all you sent me forth to do with your mutual approbation let me come home and dwell with you o my father hymns no 139 in the name of jesus christ amen
