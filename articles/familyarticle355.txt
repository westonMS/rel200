counsel to the saints by president ezra taft benson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imagepresident ezra taft benson ten years ago president spencer w kimball stood at this pulpit in that conference he was sustained by saints throughout the world as president of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints in the decade of his leadership that has followed we have seen progress and growth unequaled in the history of the church in his first conference address as president of the church president kimball declared the program of the church is to reaffirm and boldly carry forward the work of god in cleanliness uprightness and to take that gospel of truth to that world that needs so much that godly life ensign may 1974 p 8 my message today is to provide counsel on how we as a church and as individuals can carry forward the work of god to all the world first we need to strengthen families we must recognize that the family is the cornerstone of civilization and that no nation will rise above the caliber of its homes the family is the rock foundation of the church we therefore call on the head of every household to strengthen the family we believe marriage was ordained by god for a wise eternal purpose the family is the basis of the righteous life divinely prescribed roles of father mother and children were given from the very beginning god established that fathers are to preside in the home fathers are to provide love teach and direct a mothers role is also godordained mothers are to conceive bear nourish love and train they are to be helpmates and are to counsel with their husbands there is no inequality between the sexes in gods plan it is a matter of division of responsibility children are likewise counseled in holy writ in their duty to parents children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honour thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth eph 613 said the apostle paul when parents in companionship love and unity fulfill their heavenimposed responsibility and children respond with love and obedience great joy is the result recently a letter came to me from a member of the church describing some of the difficulties and challenges that a husband and his wife were having in rearing their children they were married in the temple but subsequently drifted into inactivity they had only recently become active again in church responsibility they asked for personal counsel as to what they might do to ensure that their children would remain faithful to the gospel and avoid some of the pitfalls that they had experienced and had seen come to other families in other words they were asking how can we spiritually strengthen our family i would invite each of you to ponder that significant question as a response to this request i would further invite you to consider the tried and tested formula that successful families have used over the years to attain love unity and loyalty to one another and to understand the principles of the gospel successful families have love and respect for each family member family members know they are loved and appreciated children feel they are loved by their parents thus they are secure and selfassured strong families cultivate an attribute of effective communication they talk out their problems make plans together and cooperate toward common objectives family home evening and family councils are practiced and used as effective tools toward this end fathers and mothers in strong families stay close to their children they talk some fathers formally interview each child others do so informally and others take occasion to regularly spend time alone with each child every family has problems and challenges but successful families try to work together toward solutions instead of resorting to criticism and contention they pray for each other discuss and give encouragement occasionally these families fast together in support of one of the family members strong families support each other successful families do things together family projects work vacations recreation and reunions successful parents have found that it is not easy to rear children in an environment polluted with evil therefore they take deliberate steps to provide the best of wholesome influences moral principles are taught good books are made available and read television watching is controlled good and uplifting music is provided but most importantly the scriptures are read and discussed as a means to help develop spiritualmindedness in successful latterday saint homes parents teach their children to understand faith in god repentance baptism and the gift of the holy ghost see dc 6825 family prayer is a consistent practice in these families prayer is the means to acknowledge appreciation for blessings and to humbly recognize dependence on almighty god for strength sustenance and support it is a wise and true maxim that families that kneel together stand upright before the lord this then is the tried and proven formula for rearing successful families i commend the formula to you as parents and grandparents in zion it has been the shared hope of my wife and me that all of us will be together in the eternitiesthat all will be worthy without a single empty chair that is my fervent hope and prayer for each family in the church now may i direct some remarks to us as members of the church individually more than at any time in our history brothers and sisters we have need for greater spirituality the way to develop greater spirituality is to feast on the words of christ as revealed in the scriptures one of the most significant happenings in recent church history is the publication of the new editions of the standard works with the new footnotes and other helps i think we can say without exaggeration that never before in any dispensation have the saints been so abundantly blessed with the words of the lord and his prophets now our challenge is to do as the lord commanded study my word which hath gone forth among the children of men dc 1122 this year we are to read the book of mormon in the adult curriculum of the church the prophet joseph smith said of this sacred record the book of mormon is the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of our religion and a man would get nearer to god by abiding by its precepts than by any other book teachings of the prophet joseph smith comp joseph fielding smith salt lake city deseret book co 1977 p 194

great a cause go forward and not backward courage and on on to victory dc 12822 some of our members have become disturbed because of derogatory things said about the church and its leaders or because of misrepresentations about our doctrines or our practices but opposition is not new to the church we have had opposition in the past and we shall continue to have opposition in the future do not become discouraged by what others say or do stay on the strait and narrow path you do this by holding fast to the iron rodthe words of god as contained in the scriptures and as given by his living servants on this earth i carry with me a statement of the lord from the book of mormon which my brethren of the twelve have heard me quote the passage reads as follows no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall revile against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith the lord 3 ne
