within the clasp of your arms by jeffrey r holland president of brigham young university brethren it is impossible to express the overwhelming sense of responsibility i feel tonight like the mule who entered the kentucky derby i know i probably shouldnt be here but i surely like the company it lets me keep tonight i include in that special company my son matt whom i love with all my heart i pray earnestly for the spirit of the lord to be with us in our assignment brethren a recent study conducted by the church has forcefully confirmed statistically what we have been told again and again that is if loving inspired instruction and example are not provided at home then our related efforts for success in and around church programs are severely limited it is increasingly clear that we must teach the gospel to our families personally live those teachings in our homes or run the risk of discovering too late that a primary teacher or priesthood adviser or seminary instructor could not do for our children what we would not do for them may i offer just this much encouragement regarding such a great responsibility what i cherish in my relationship with matt is that he is along with his mother and sister and brother my closest dearest friend i would rather be here at this priesthood meeting tonight with my son than with any other male companion in this world i love to be with him we talk a lot we laugh a lot we play oneonone basketball we play tennis and racquetball though i do refuse to play golf with him thats a private joke we discuss problems i am the president of a small university and he is the president of a large high school class we compare notes and offer suggestions and share each others challenges i pray for him and have cried with him and im immensely proud of him weve talked long into the night lying on his water bed a twentiethcentury aberration which i know as part of the punishment of the last days will one day burst and wash the hollands helplessly into the streets of provo thats another private joke i feel i can talk to matt about how he is enjoying seminary because i try to talk to him about all of his classes at school we often imagine together what his mission will be like because he knows how much my mission meant to me and he asks me about temple marriage because he knows i am absolutely crazy about his mother he wants his future wife to be like her and for them to have what we have now even as i speak i know that there are fathers and sons in this meeting tonight who feel they do not have any portion of what is here described i know there are fathers who would give virtually their very lives to be close again to a struggling son i know there are sons in our meeting who wish their dads were at their side tonight or any night i have wondered how to speak on this assigned topic without sounding selfrighteous on the one hand or offending already tender hearts on the other in answer to that i simply say to us all young and old never give up keep trying keep reaching keep talking keep prayingbut never give up above all never pull away from each other may i share a brief but painful moment from my own inadequate efforts as a father early in our married life my young family and i were laboring through graduate school at a university in new england pat was the relief society president in our ward and i was serving in our stake presidency i was going to school fulltime and teaching halftime we had two small children then with little money and lots of pressures in fact our life was about like yours one evening i came home from long hours at school feeling the proverbial weight of the world on my shoulders everything seemed to be especially demanding and discouraging and dark i wondered if the dawn would ever come then as i walked into our small student apartment there was an unusual silence in the room whats the trouble i asked matthew has something he wants to tell you pat said matt what do you have to tell me he was quietly playing with his toys in the corner of the room trying very hard not to hear me matt i said a little louder do you have something to tell me he stopped playing but for a moment didnt look up then these two enormous tearfilled brown eyes turned toward me and with the pain only a fiveyearold can know he said i didnt mind mommy tonight and i spoke back to her with that he burst into tears and his entire little body shook with grief a childish indiscretion had been noted a painful confession had been offered the growth of a fiveyearold was continuing and loving reconciliation could have been wonderfully underway everything might have been just terrificexcept for me if you can imagine such an idiotic thing i lost my temper it wasnt that i lost it with mattit was with a hundred and one other things on my mind but he didnt know that and i wasnt disciplined enough to admit it he got the whole load of bricks i told him how disappointed i was and how much more i thought i could have expected from him i sounded like the parental pygmy i was then i did what i had never done before in his lifei told him that he was to go straight to bed and that i would not be in to say his prayers with him or to tell him a bedtime story muffling his sobs he obediently went to his bedside where he kneltaloneto say his prayers then he stained his little pillow with tears his father should have been wiping away if you think the silence upon my arrival was heavy you should have felt it now pat did not say a word she didnt have to i felt terrible later as we knelt by our own bed my feeble prayer for blessings upon my family fell back on my ears with a horrible hollow ring i wanted to get up off my knees right then and go to matt and ask his forgiveness but he was long since peacefully asleep my relief was not so soon coming but finally i fell asleep and began to dream which i seldom do i dreamed matt and i were packing two cars for a move for some reason his mother and baby sister were not present as we finished i turned to him and said okay matt you drive one car and ill drive the other this fiveyearold very obediently crawled up on the seat and tried to grasp the massive steering wheel i walked over to the other car and started the motor as i began to pull away i looked to see how my son was doing he was tryingoh how he was trying he tried to reach the pedals but he couldnt he was also turning knobs and pushing buttons trying to start the motor he could scarcely be seen over the dashboard but there staring out at me again were those same immense tearfilled beautiful brown eyes as i pulled away he cried out daddy dont leave me i dont know how to do it i am too little and i drove away a short time later driving down that desert road in my dream i suddenly realized in one stark horrifying moment what i had done i slammed my car to a stop threw open the door and started to run as fast as i could i left car keys belongings and alland i ran the pavement was so hot it burned my feet and tears blinded my straining effort to see this child somewhere on the horizon i kept running praying pleading to be forgiven and to find my boy safe and secure as i rounded a curve nearly ready to drop from physical and emotional exhaustion i saw the unfamiliar car i had left matt to drive it was pulled carefully off to the side of the road and he was laughing and playing nearby an older man was with him playing and responding to his games matt saw me and cried out something like hi dad were having fun obviously he had already forgiven and forgotten my terrible transgression against him but i dreaded the older mans gaze which followed my every move i tried to say thank you but his eyes were filled with sorrow and disappointment i muttered an awkward apology and the stranger said simply you should not have left him alone to do this difficult thing it would not have been asked of you with that the dream ended and i shot upright in bed my pillow was now stained whether with perspiration or tears i do not know i threw off the covers and ran to the little metal camp cot that was my sons bed there on my knees and through my tears i cradled him in my arms and spoke to him while he slept i told him that every dad makes mistakes but that they dont mean to i told him it wasnt his fault i had had a bad day i told him that when boys are five or fifteen dads sometimes forget and think they are fifty i told him that i wanted him to be a small boy for a long long time because all too soon he would grow up and be a man and wouldnt be playing on the floor with his toys when i came home i told him that i loved him and his mother and his sister more than anything in the world and that whatever challenges we had in life we would face them together i told him that never again would i withhold my affection or my forgiveness from him and never i prayed would he withhold them from me i told him i was honored to be his father and that i would try with all my heart to be worthy of such a great responsibility well i have not proven to be the perfect father i vowed to be that night and a thousand nights before and since but i still want to be and i believe this wise counsel from president joseph f smith brethren if you will keep your children close to your heart within the clasp of your arms if you will make them feel that you love them and keep them near to you they will not go very far from you and they will not commit any very great sin but it is when you turn them out of the home turn them out of your affection that is what drives them from you fathers if you wish your children to be taught in the principles of the gospel if you wish them to love the truth and understand it if you wish them to be obedient to and united with you love them and prove that you do love them by your every word and act toward them gospel doctrine 5th ed salt lake city deseret book co 1966 pp 282 316 brethren we all know fatherhood is not an easy assignment but it ranks among the most imperative ever given in time or eternity we must not pull away from our children we must keep trying keep reaching keep praying keep listening we must keep them within the clasp of our arms that is what friends are for of this i bear witness in the name of jesus christ amen
