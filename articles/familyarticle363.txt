the honored place of woman by president ezra taft benson president of the quorum of the twelve apostles imagepresident ezra taft benson this is an inspiring and glorious sight i am most honored and uplifted to be in your presence i speak to you tonight not necessarily as members of the great relief society organization of the church but as choice womendaughters of our heavenly father last april i was privileged to speak to the priesthood brethren on a fathers responsibility tonight i talk to you sisters on the honored place of women in the eternal plan of our heavenly father sound principles and eternal truths need to be frequently repeated so that we do not forget their application nor become dissuaded by other arguments the world is increasing in wickedness temptations are greater than they have ever been in the memory of any of us in the face of these conditionsand they will get worsepresident spencer w kimball said in an address to regional representatives relief society leaders and teachers should ask how can we help the wife and mother understand the dignity and worth of her role in the divine process of motherhood how can we help her make her home a place of love and learning a place of refuge and refinement ensign may 1978 p 101 we must ever keep in mind that it is the design of satan to thwart the plan of our eternal father the plan of the adversary is to destroy the youth of the churchthe rising generation as the book of mormon calls them see alma 549and to destroy the family unit in the beginning god placed a woman in a companion role with the priesthood god said it was not good that the man should be alone wherefore i will make an help meet for him moses 318 woman was given to man as an helpmeet that complementary association is ideally portrayed in the eternal marriage of our first parentsadam and eve they labored together they had children together they prayed together and they taught their children the gospel together this is the pattern god would have all righteous men and women imitate before the world was created in heavenly councils the pattern and role of women were prescribed you were elected by god to be wives and mothers in zion exaltation in the celestial kingdom is predicated on faithfulness to that calling since the beginning a womans first and most important role has been ushering into mortality spirit sons and daughters of our father in heaven since the beginning her role has been to teach her children eternal gospel principles she is to provide for her children a haven of security and loveregardless of how modest her circumstances might be in the beginning adam was instructed to earn the bread by the sweat of his brownot eve contrary to conventional wisdom a mothers place is in the home i recognize there are voices in our midst which would attempt to convince you that these truths are not applicable to our presentday conditions if you listen and heed you will be lured away from your principal obligations beguiling voices in the world cry out for alternative lifestyles for women they maintain that some women are better suited for careers than for marriage and motherhood these individuals spread their discontent by the propaganda that there are more exciting and selffulfilling roles for women than homemaking some even have been bold to suggest that the church move away from the mormon woman stereotype of homemaking and rearing children they also say it is wise to limit your family so you can have more time for personal goals and selffulfillment i am aware that many of you often find yourselves in circumstances that are not always ideal i know this because i have talked with many of you who because of necessity must work and leave your children with otherseven though your heart is in your home to you go my love and sympathy for your present and i hope temporary situation and my prayers that you will be blessed by our heavenly father to compensate for a situation that is less than you may desire i recognize that some sisters are widowed or divorced my heart is drawn to you who are in these circumstances the brethren pray for you and we feel a great obligation to see that your needs are met trust in the lord be assured he loves you and we love you resist bitterness and cynicism i also recognize that not all women in the church will have an opportunity for marriage and motherhood in mortality but if you in this situation are worthy and endure faithfully you can be assured of all blessings from a kind and loving heavenly fatherand i emphasize all blessings solutions for you who are in a minority are not the same as for the majority of women in the church who can and should be fulfilling their roles as wives and mothers it is a misguided idea that a woman should leave the home where there is a husband and children to prepare educationally and financially for an unforeseen eventuality too often i fear even women in the church use the world as their standard for success and basis for selfworth president kimball once said that latterday saints need a style of our own pertaining to clothing we must also have a style of our own pertaining to success and selfimage some saints are deluded into believing that more and better circumstances will improve their selfimage a positive selfimage has little relationship to our material circumstances mary the mother of our savior was of most modest circumstances yet she knew well her responsibility and took joy in it remember her humble exclamation to her cousin elisabeth he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed luke 148 italics added her strength was inward not from outward material things it is a fundamental truth that the responsibilities of motherhood cannot be successfully delegated no not to daycare centers not to schools not to nurseries not to babysitters we become enamored with mens theories such as the idea of preschool training outside the home for young children not only does this put added pressure on the budget but it places young children in an environment away from mothers influence too often the pressure for popularity on children and teens places an economic burden on the income of the father so mother feels she must go to work to satisfy her childrens needs that decision can be most shortsighted it is mothers influence during the crucial formative years that forms a childs basic character home is the place where a child learns faith feels love and thereby learns from mothers loving example to choose righteousness how vital are mothers influence and teaching in the homeand how apparent when neglected i do not wish to wound any feelings but all of us are aware of instances of active latterday saint families who are experiencing difficulties with their children because mother is not where she ought to bein the home a recent national magazine gave these alarming figures more than 14 million children ages 6 to 13 now have working mothers and it is estimated that a third of them are unsupervised for lengthy periods each day us news and world report 14 sept 1981 p 42 the seeds of divorce are often sown and the problems of children begin when mother works outside the home you mothers should carefully count the cost before you decide to share breadwinning responsibilities with your husbands it is a truism that children need more of mother than of money president joseph f smith said that parents in zion will be held responsible for the acts of their children not only until they become eight years old but perhaps throughout all the lives of their children provided they have neglected their duty to their children while they were under their care and guidance and the parents were responsible for them in conference report apr 1910 p 6 one of the most stirring success stories in scripture is told in the book of mormon of lamanite women who taught their sons the gospel in the home these two thousand young men were taught faith in god at their mothers knees later they exhibited great faith and courage when they went to war their leader helaman said of them yea they had been taught by their mothers that if they did not doubt god would deliver them alma 5647 there is the keythey had been taught by their mothers years ago a son wrote to his mother and asked her what she did to successfully rear her childrenall nineteen of them she wrote him this reply the writing anything about my way of education i am much adverse to it cannot i think be of service to anyone to know how i who have lived such a retired life for so many years used to employ my time and care in bringing up my own children no one can without renouncing the world in the most literal sense observe my methods and there are few if any that would entirely devote above twenty years of the prime of life in hopes to save souls of their children which they think may be saved without so much ado for that was my principal intention however unskillfully and unsuccessfully managed franklin wilder immortal mother new york vantage press 1966 p 43 italics added that mother was susannah wesley and the son who wrote was john wesley one of the great reformers twenty years of the prime of life in the hopes of saving the souls of her children such a task required skill competence courage intelligence and ingenuity far above any career do you want a principle for successful motherhood make time to teach your children the gospel and principles of gospel living when they are young it may be that you too will need to renounce the world and devote above twenty years of the prime of life in hopes to save the souls of your children no accomplishment transcends the building of the character of a son or a daughter of god in preparing for these remarks i invited several wives and mothers to send to me their comments on solutions to problems facing our latterday saint women i want you to hear from these successful homemakersintelligent faithful womenwho understand their callings in this life one wife and mother said i am truly happy in my role as a homemaker wife and mother my own dear mother taught me to find joy in homemaking i always felt that my mother was happy in her role as homemaker no mention was made of our modernday womens liberation for to us a good wife and mother was the epitome of womanhood another wrote i enjoy being a wife and mother more than anything else i actually enjoy doing it she would counsel sisters if homemaking doesnt come naturally ask the lord to help you enjoy it and he will have faith in the lord trust not in the arm of flesh keep an eternal perspective especially when you think that diapers and night feedings will never end youre doing what the lord wants you to do and you will be blessed she continues be proud to be a wife and mother apologize to no one keep away from influences that degrade your role such as tv soaps magazine articles speeches made by socalled experts another young mother wrote being a wife and mother and having a family is my first priority this is more important than a college degree a job developing talents or anything else what job in life could possibly be more important than molding the character of another human being and from this mothera solution to the problems besetting sisters the great strength of a good womana saint if you willis her personal testimony of the savior and her faith in his spokesmen the prophet and the apostles of jesus christ if she follows them she will have the countenance of christ for her beauty the peace of christ to support her emotionally the saviors example as a means to solve her problems and to strengthen her and the love of christ as the source of love for herself her family and those about her she can be sure of herself as a wife and mother and find joy and fulfillment in her role in the home i endorse that sound counsel to all you sisters another lovely sister wrote keep praising the mothers in zion who are trying so hard and keep loving us and praying for us for we believe in the counsel of and cherish the words of the brethren taking courage from that request and with helpful suggestions from sister benson i share these thoughts with you radiate a spirit of contentment and joy with homemaking you teach by example your attitude toward homemaking your attitude will say to your children i am only a housewife or it will convey homemaking is the highest most noble profession to which a woman might aspire provide your daughters with opportunities to develop their own skills by allowing them to bake cook sew and arrange their own rooms have daily family devotion in your home you teach your children dependence on the lord by your morning and evening family prayers reading scriptures in the home should be a habit under your husbands direction have weekly family home

questions by listening to them every day discuss with them such important matters as dating sex and other matters affecting their growth and development and do it early enough so they will not obtain information from questionable sources treat your children with respect and kindnessjust as you would when guests are present they are after all more meaningful to you than guests teach your children never to speak unkindly to others regarding members of the family be loyal to one another implant within them a desire to serve others teach them to be thoughtful to the aged the sick and the lonely help them to plan early for a mission so they can bless others who do not have the gospel guard against the temptations of seeking after material things the constant craze to appear more youthful and worldly the limiting of the size of your family when health of the mother or infant is not the concern and personal selfishness which will deprive you of the joy of helping others all these problems contribute to ingratitude uncharitableness and emotional instability support encourage and strengthen your husband in his responsibility as patriarch in the home you are partners with him a womans role in a mans life is to lift him to help him uphold lofty standards and to prepare through righteous living to be his queen for all eternity home is love understanding trust welcome and a sense of belonging if you as wives mothers daughters take proper care of yourselves your families and your homes and keep close to each other as sisters in the relief society many of the problems of the day troubling youth and parents will pass you by president mckay said the home is the first and most effective place for children to learn the lessons of life truth honor virtue selfcontrol the value of education honest work and the purpose and privilege of life nothing can take the place of home in rearing and teaching children and no other success can compensate for failure in the home family home

family from this danger just as you would instinctively protect them from physical harm with your companion make it a family objective to all be together in the celestial kingdom strive to make your
