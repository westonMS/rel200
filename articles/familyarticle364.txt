love extends beyond convenience by bishop j richard clarke second counselor in the presiding bishopric imagebishop j richard clarke brothers and sisters rikki pace the fifteenyearold daughter of glenn pace our new managing director of the welfare department was overheard in a conversation with a school friend it went something like this where does your dad work at the church office building wheres the church office building you know that tall building by the temple what does he do hes in charge of the welfare department whats the welfare department well after several attempts to explain it didnt appear as if any big impressions had been made so with one final attempt to put the subject to rest rikki said let me put it this way between now and the millennium if a member of the church starves to death its all my dads fault there are many perceptions of welfare services i suppose most people perceive of welfare as farms canneries bishops storehouses and deseret industries welfare services is essential to that part of the central mission of the church which is to perfect the saints welfare services is the gospel in action for individual members it is not just for group or institutional involvement salvation comes to us on an individual basiseach must climb the ladder independently to ascend to the level of the master if we are to achieve perfection we must emulate the works of jesus as well as his words the apostle peter instructed those who would be disciples of christ to be partakers of the divine nature 2 pet 147 he told them for even hereunto were ye called that ye should follow his steps 1 pet 221 in 1897 dr charles sheldon a young minister in topeka kansas wrote a book which he titled in his steps it was a novel based upon an experiment he tried he disguised himself as an unemployed printer and tramped the streets of topeka he was shocked at his treatment by this christian community in his novel a christian minister presents his congregation with this interesting challenge i want volunteers who will pledge themselves earnestly and honestly for an entire year not to do anything without first asking the question what would jesus do our aim will be to act just as he would if he were in our places regardless of immediate results in other words we propose to follow jesus steps as closely and as literally as we believe he taught his disciples to do charles m sheldon in his steps new york grosset dunlap 1935 pp 1516 the book describes the fascinating experience of those who accepted the challenge i have been intrigued by the experiment and wonder if it were conducted today among the latterday saints how we would measure up as latterday christians we know that the royal law james 28 of love in action is to succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees dc 815 do we catch the significance of this thought we demonstrate the depth of our love for the savior when we care enough to seek out the suffering among us and attend to their needs the philosopher william george jordan has identified four great hungers of lifebodyhunger mindhunger hearthunger and soulhunger they are all real all need recognition all need feeding william george jordan the crown of individuality new york fleming h revell company 1909 p 63 bodyhunger is our most conscious biological need it is difficult to be spiritually strong when temporally deficient mindhunger is a craving for intellectual food for education and for personal development hearthunger is to be lonely to have low selfesteem to be misunderstood to crave companionship sympathy and appreciation however we find that as we seek to satisfy the hearthunger of our neighbor we reduce our own soulhunger is the burning desire to know eternal truth it is the yearning of the spirit to commune with god see jordan pp 6375 the restored gospel of jesus christ provides the solution to all the hungers of life jesus said i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst john 635 we would all like to have the saviors capacity to assuage the hungers of the world but let us not forget that there are many simple ways by which we can walk in his steps let us remember that in giving of ourselves it is less a question of giving a lot than of giving at the right moment a noted columnist erma bombeck described an experience which reminds us that little things can mean a lot she recounted a frustrating morning of numerous phone calls and interrupting conversations before leaving for the airport and then she said at last there were thirty whole beautiful minutes before my plane took offtime for me to be alone with my own thoughts to open a book and let my mind wander a voice next to me belonging to an elderly woman said ill bet its cold in chicago stonefaced i answered its likely i havent been to chicago in nearly three years she persisted my son lives there thats nice i said my eyes intent on the printed page of the book my husbands body is on this plane weve been married for fiftythree years i dont drive you know and when he died a nun drove me from the hospital we arent even catholic the funeral director let me come to the airport with him erma said i dont think i have ever detested myself more than i did at that moment another human being was screaming to be heard and in desperation had turned to a cold stranger who was more interested in a novel than in the reallife drama at her elbow all she needed was a listenerno advice wisdom experience money assistance expertise or even compassionbut just a minute or two to listen she talked numbly and steadily until we boarded the plane and then found her seat in another section as i hung up my coat i heard her plaintive voice say to her seat companion ill bet its cold in chicago i prayed please god let her listen erma bombeck are you listening if life is a bowl of cherrieswhat am i doing in the pits new york mcgrawhill book co 1978 pp 19798 how many times have we observed a benevolent act performed by someone and asked ourselves why didnt i think of that those who do the deeds we would have liked to do seem to have mastered the art of awareness they have formed the habit of being sensitive to the needs of others before they think of themselves how swiftly opportunity slips away and we are left with another unfulfilled good intention if only our acts of kindness could equal the righteous desires of our hearts striking a blow at our propensity to delay our acting as we know we should the poet john drinkwater penned his poem a prayer which i quote in part we know the paths wherein our feet should press across our hearts are written thy decrees yet now o lord be merciful to bless with more than these grant us the will to fashion as we feel grant us the strength to labour as we know grant us the purpose ribbed and edged with steel to strike the blow knowledge we ask notknowledge thou hast lent but lord the willthere lies our bitter need give us to build above the deep intent the deed the deed in masterpieces of religious verse ed james dalton morrison new york harper brothers publishers 1948 p 418 when i think of performing deeds of kindness i immediately think of bishops and relief society presidents relatively few people know of the many hours they selflessly spend in serving members of their wards they truly translate principles into deeds to illustrate i quote this heartwarming pioneer account many years ago in a small town in the southern part of the state of utah my great grandmother was called to be the president of the relief society during this period of our churchs history there existed a very bitter and antagonistic spirit between the mormons and the gentiles in my great grandmothers ward one of the young sisters married a gentile boy this of course did not please either the mormons or the gentiles very much in the course of time this young couple gave birth to a child unfortunately the mother became so ill in the process of childbirth that she was unable to care for her baby upon learning of this womans condition great grandmother immediately went to the homes of the sisters in the ward and asked them if they would take a turn going into the home of this young couple to care for the baby one by one these women refused and so the responsibility fell completely upon her she would arise early in the morning walk what was a considerable distance to the home of this young couple where she would bathe and feed the baby gather all that needed to be laundered and take it with her to her home one morning she felt too weak and sick to go however as she lay in bed she realized that if she didnt go the child would not be provided for with the help of the lord she mustered all her strength and went when she returned home exhausted she collapsed into a large chair and immediately fell into a deep sleep she said that as she slept she felt as if she were consumed by a fire that would melt the very marrow of her bones she dreamed that she was bathing the christ child and glorying in what a great privilege it would have been to have bathed the son of god then the voice of the lord spoke to her saying inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these ye have done it unto me my errand from the lord a personal study guide for melchizedek priesthood quorums 197677 pp 15455 perhaps the most heroic acts are done quietly and with no recognition except from a loving heavenly father who rewards us with the sweet peace that passeth understanding see philip 47 and by his spirit whispers well done my good and faithful servant matt 2521 i was touched by an experience that was recently related to me a dear sister had been incapacitated for the past eight yearsshe could not walk or talk and was confined to bed about six years ago she and her husband were assigned a faithful home teacher he asked if his wife could come over to their house every sunday morning and stay with the invalid woman while her husband attended priesthood meeting for six years every sunday this home teacher would bring his wife over to stay with the invalid sister while her husband went to his meeting and every sunday the home teachers wife would bring with her some baked goods or something special that she had made for this older couple finally this sister who had been ill passed away when her daughter tried to express her deep love and appreciation to this loving home teacher and his wife for what they had done over the years the wife said oh dont thank us it was our privilege to visit with your sweet mother what am i going to do now the hour and a half on sunday morning will now be for me the loneliest hour and a half in the week i am impressed that in the last moments of the saviors life he had an abiding concern for his mother and for her welfare thus again setting the example for us walking in his steps are the devoted sons and daughters who honor aging parents who are no longer able to help themselves about two years ago i read this column in the newspaper dear abby im sitting here on the plane reading the letter in your column about the son who didnt want to put his father up temporarily because he felt his fathers visit would be an invasion of his privacy that item caught my eye because i am on my way to visit my son in omaha for two weeksat his insistence i was reluctant to do so initially because i felt i might be interfering with his personal activities i wonder if the son who wrote that letter ever gave a thought to the privacy his father might have forfeited during his sons time at home there were times during my childrens lives when given my druthers id have preferred some alternative activity but now i dont regret one minute of the time i spent with them im only sorry it couldnt have been more their time at home seems to have been so brief i wont mail this of course since i realize you will receive thousands of more articulate letters on the above this is just my way of dear abby my father died suddenly of a heart attack and this unfinished letter was in his pocket my wife and i will miss him very much sign thisa son who really wanted his dad to come william smzyk omaha nebr abigail van buren deseret news 13 dec 1979 p c7 brothers and sisters what i have tried to illustrate this morning is that if we are to walk in the steps of the savior we cannot do it without personal sacrifice and sincere involvement it is rarely convenient but love extends beyond convenience for those who have conditioned themselves to look for opportunities to serve i believe that the savior was equipped to accomplish his mission not only through his parentage but because of his thirty years of preparation in developing an awareness of and a sensitivity to the needs of his fellowmen in alma chapter seven we read and he shall go forth suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people and he will take upon him their infirmities that his bowels may be filled with mercy according to the flesh that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people alma 71112 after a recent stake conference meeting where i had discussed the role of the family in the church i was approached by a sweet woman who said bishop im a widow and i really appreciated everything you said today i have a lovely family but i have many problems and i do need help my priesthood leaders have families of their own and they have lots of problems and i dont want to bother them and add to their problems so what should i do i asked her do you have a good home teacher who really cares about you she said yes i have a home teacher and he comes by every month or so but he isnt very involved with our family then i asked well do you have a visiting teacher who visits you and understands you she said yes the relief society sometimes comes at this point i was praying for a right answer when a lovely sister who was standing nearby and heard our conversation said excuse me but i was a widow and even though i have just remarried i know how you feel and i understand your problems please let me drop by id like to visit with you dr tom dooley offers some interesting insights regarding those who have known difficulties and can now share the burden of another i quote one of dr albert schweitzers most important concepts is that of the fellowship of those who bear the mark of pain who are its members those who have learned by experience what physical pain and bodily anguish mean these people all over the world are united by a secret bond he who has been delivered from pain must not think he is now at liberty to continue his life and forget his sickness he is a man whose eyes are opened he now has a duty to help others in their battles with pain and anguish he must help to bring to others the deliverance which he himself knows under this fellowship come not only those who were formerly sick but those who are related to sufferers and whom does this not include thomas dooley a worldwide fellowship words of wisdom ed thomas c jones chicago j b ferguson 1966 p 150 again i refer to dr sheldons book it is the personal element that christian discipleship needs to emphasize the gift without the giver is bare the christianity that attempts to suffer by proxy alone is not the christianity of christ each individual christian needs to follow in his steps along the path of personal sacrifice to him there is not a different path today from that of jesus own times it is the same path sheldon in his steps p 239 italics added this has been a difficult assignment for me as i have pondered how practicing welfare principles brings us to christ i have searched my own soul and realized that i am far short of my idealthe savior as a result i have recommitted myself to achieve the divine nature of christ see 2 pet 14 by becoming more aware of ways in which to bless those in need i bear my testimony to you that there is a special spirit of the savior which accompanies welfare services i know he loves this work and the thousands of saints who are engaged in it and as he counseled his covenant people in the book of mormon so he entreats us today verily verily i say unto you this is my gospel and ye know the things that ye must do in my church for the works which ye have seen me do that shall ye also do therefore if ye do these things blessed are ye for ye shall be lifted up at the last day therefore what manner of men ought ye to be verily i say unto you even as i am 3 ne 272122 27 that we may walk in his steps and become even as he is i pray in the sacred name of the lord jesus christ amen
