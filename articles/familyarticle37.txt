earning the trust of the lord and your family by elder richard j maynes of the seventy imageelder richard j maynes men who have integrity of heart are men to be trustedbecause trust is built on integrity brethren perhaps there is no greater compliment we could receive from the lord than to know he trusts us to be worthy priesthood holders and great husbands and fathers one thing is for certain earning the lords trust is a blessing that comes through great effort on our part trust is a blessing based on obedience to gods laws earning the lords trust comes as a result of being true to the covenants we have made in the waters of baptism and in the holy temple when we keep our promises to the lord his trust in us grows i love both ancient and modernday scriptures that use the phrase integrity of heart when describing a righteous persons character1 integrity or the lack of integrity is a fundamental element of ones character men who have integrity of heart are men to be trustedbecause trust is built on integrity being a man of integrity simply means your intentions as well as your actions are pure and righteous in all aspects of your life both in public and in private with each decision we make we either merit more of gods trust or diminish his trust this principle is perhaps most clearly manifest in our divinely appointed responsibilities as husbands and fathers as husbands and fathers we have received a divine charge from modernday prophets seers and revelators in the document the family a proclamation to the world this document teaches us that 1 fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness 2 fathers are responsible to provide the necessities of life and 3 fathers are responsible to protect their families2 for us to earn gods trust we will need to accomplish these three divinely appointed responsibilities to our families in the lords way as further stated in the family proclamation the lords way is to fulfill these responsibilities together with our wives as equal partners3 to me this means we do not move forward with any significant decision regarding these three responsibilities without total unity with our wives the first step in our quest to earn the lords trust is to place our trust in him the prophet nephi exemplified this type of commitment when he prayed o lord i have trusted in thee and i will trust in thee forever i will not put my trust in the arm of flesh4 nephi was fully committed to doing the lords will in addition to saying he would do the things which the lord hath commanded nephi was unwavering in his commitment to accomplishing his assignments as illustrated in this statement as the lord liveth and as we live we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the lord hath commanded us5 because nephi first trusted in god god put great trust in nephi the lord blessed him with great outpourings of the spirit that blessed his life the lives of his family and the lives of his people because nephi presided in love and righteousness and provided for and protected his family and people he records we lived after the manner of happiness6 in order to represent a womans perspective on this subject i asked my two married daughters to help me i asked if they would provide a sentence or two on how they viewed the importance of trust as it affects their marriage and family life here are the thoughts of lara harris and christina hansen first lara one of the most important things to me is knowing that as my husband goes about his day he is making choices that show respect and love toward me when we can trust each other in this way it brings peace to our home where we can enjoy raising our family together now christinas thoughts having trust in someone is similar to having faith in someone without that trust and faith theres fear and doubt for me one of the greatest blessings that come from being able to fully trust my husband is peacepeace of mind knowing that he actually does what he says he will do trust brings peace love and an environment where that love can grow lara and christina never saw what the other had written it is so interesting to me that both of them independently considered the blessing of peace in the home to be a direct consequence of having a husband they could trust as illustrated by my daughters examples the principle of trust plays an extremely important role in the development of a christcentered home i was also able to enjoy that same christcentered culture growing up in a home where my father honored his priesthood and gained the trust of the entire family due to the integrity of his heart7 let me share with you an experience from my youth that illustrates the lasting positive impact that a father who understands and lives the principle of trust built on integrity can have on his family when i was very young my father founded a company that specialized in factory automation this business engineered fabricated and installed automated production lines worldwide when i was in middle school my father wanted me to learn how to work he also wanted me to learn the business from the ground up my first job included maintaining the grounds and painting areas of the facility not visible to the general public when i entered high school i was promoted to work on the factory floor i started to learn how to read blueprints and run heavy steel fabrication machinery after high school graduation i attended university and then entered the mission field returning home from my mission i went straight back to work i needed to earn money for the next years school expenses one day soon after my mission i was working in the factory when my father called me into his office and asked if i would like to go with him on a business trip to los angeles this was the first time my father invited me to accompany him on a business trip he was actually letting me go out in public to help represent the company before we left on the trip he prepared me with a few details about this potential new client first the client was a multinational corporation second they were upgrading their production lines worldwide with the latest in automation technology third our company had never previously supplied them with engineering services or technology and finally their top corporate officer in charge of purchasing had called this meeting to review our bid on a new project this meeting represented a new and potentially important opportunity for our company after arriving in los angeles my father and i went to the executives hotel for the meeting the first order of business was to discuss and analyze the engineering design specifications of the project the next discussion item concerned operational details including logistics and delivery dates the concluding agenda item focused on pricing terms and conditions this is where things got interesting this corporate officer explained to us that our price proposal was the lowest of those who had submitted bids on the project he then curiously told us the price of the secondlowest bid he then asked us if we would be willing to take our proposal back and resubmit it he stated that our new price should come in just below the next highest bid he then explained that we would split the newly added dollars 5050 with him he rationalized this by saying that everyone would win our company would win because we would be making considerably more money than our original bid provided his company would win because they would still be doing business with the lowest bidder and of course he would win by taking his cut because he put this great deal together he then gave us a post office box number where we could send the money he requested after all of this he looked at my father and asked so do we have a deal much to my surprise my father stood up shook his hand and told him we would get back to him after leaving the meeting we got into the rental car and my father turned to me and asked well what do you think we should do i responded by saying i didnt think we should accept this offer my father then asked dont you think we have a responsibility to all of our employees to maintain a good backlog of work while i was contemplating his question and before i could answer he answered his own question he said listen rick once you take a bribe or compromise your integrity it is very difficult to ever get it back dont ever do it not even once the fact that im sharing this experience means that i have never forgotten what my father taught me on that first business trip with him i share this experience to illustrate the lasting influence we have as fathers you can imagine the trust i had in my father due to the integrity of his heart he lived these same principles in his private life with my mother his children and all with whom he associated brethren it is my prayer this evening that we might all first place our trust in the lord as nephi exemplified and then through the integrity of our hearts earn the trust of the lord as well as the trust of our wives and children as we understand and apply this sacred principle of trust built on integrity we will be true to our sacred covenants we will also succeed in presiding in our families with love and righteousness providing the necessities of life and protecting our families from the evils of the world of these truths i humbly testify in the name of jesus christ amen notes see for example 1 kings 94 doctrine and covenants 12415 the family a proclamation to the world ensign or liahona nov 2010 129 the family a proclamation to the world 129 2 nephi 434 1 nephi 37 15 2 nephi 527 doctrine and covenants 12415
