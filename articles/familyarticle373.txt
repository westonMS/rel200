great things required of their fathers by president ezra taft benson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imagepresident ezra taft benson when the lord declared that power is not given unto satan to tempt little children until they begin to become accountable he revealed that this period of childhood and unaccountability was given to children so that great things may be required at the hand of their fathers see dc 294748 that great things may be required at the hand of their fathers what confidence the lord has in fathers and what a responsibility he has placed on fathers great things are required of fathers today when i think of fathers i think of adamprogenitor of us allwho faithfully taught his posterity in the ways of righteousness i think of father abraham whose faith knows no peer among mortal fathers i esteem jacob or israel with a feeling akin to reverence for his diligence and longsuffering i honor the name of lehi for the example he gave to his sons in this dispensation i think of joseph smith sr first to give credence to his prophetsons testimony i think of the noble example of joseph f smith sixth president of the church and father of the tenth president i revere these noble mennot just because they were great prophets but because they were great fathers who realized what the lord required of them and they lived up to that expectation i wish to speak on this occasion to you fathers about three particular things that the lord requires of us these are things that every father with an ordinary amount of diligence may do if we will do them our homes will be blessed with peace our names will be proudly borne by our descendants and our association with our family may be eternal fathers what great things does the lord require of us first provide a home where love and the spirit of the lord may abide children are born innocent not evil they are not sent to earth however to neutral environments they are sent to homes that for good or evil influence their ideas emotions thoughts and standards by which future choices will be made one great thing the lord requires of each of us is to provide a home where a happy positive influence for good exists in future years the costliness of home furnishings or the number of bathrooms will not matter much but what will matter significantly is whether our children felt love and acceptance in the home it will greatly matter whether there was happiness and laughter or bickering and contention i am convinced that before a child can be influenced for good by his or her parents there must be a demonstration of respect and love president joseph f smith said fathers if you wish your children to be taught in the principles of the gospel if you wish them to be obedient to and united with you love them and prove to them that you do love them by your every word or act to them for your own sake for the love that should exist between you and your boyshowever wayward they might be when you speak or talk to them do it not in anger do it not harshly in a condemning spirit speak to them kindly get down and weep with them if necessary and get them to shed tears with you if possible soften their hearts get them to feel tenderly towards you use no lash and no violence but approach them with reason with persuasion and love unfeigned with this means if you cannot gain your boys and your girls there will be no means left in the world by which you can win them to yourselves liahona the elders journal 17 oct 1911 pp 26061 many suggestions could be enumerated as to what we can and should do to make our homes places of refuge and happiness i believe however that to tell a man what is expected of him is more important than to prescribe exactly how he is to get the job done once you determine that a high priority in your life is to see that your wife and your children are happy then you will do all in your power to do so i am not just speaking of satisfying material desires but of filling other vital needs such as appreciation compliments comforting encouraging listening and giving love and affection if with pleasure you are viewing anything your child is doing if you like him if you love him let him know dont withhold appreciation until others give expression if he wins your commendation tell him so more than fame and more than money is a disposition sunny and some hearty warm approval makes one glad so if you think some praise is due him nows the time to give it to him tie him close with loving language from his dad your supreme opportunity in life is fatherhood these words directed to fathers by president david o mckay should be framed by every father when one puts businesses or pleasure or the earning of additional income above his home he that moment starts on the downgrade to soul weakness when the club becomes more attractive to any man than his home it is time for him to confess in bitter shame that he has failed to measure up to the supreme opportunity of his life and flunked in the final test of true manhood the poorest shack in which love prevails over a united family is of far greater value to god and future humanity than any other riches in such a home god can work miracles and will work miracles pure hearts in a pure home are always in whispering distance of heaven church news 7 sept 1968 p 4 fathers what is the spirit in your homes second teach your children to understand principles of truth in a revelation to the prophet joseph the lord directed fathers to bring up their children in light and truth he rebuked several because of their failure to do so each of us would do well to review those principles given in section 93 to joseph smith jr frederick g williams sidney rigdon and newel k whitney in this revelation the lord states that satan cometh and taketh away light and truth through disobedience from the children of men and because of the tradition of their fathers dc 9339 the tradition of their fathers refers of course to the bad examples and teachings of fathers we must remember this world is a telestial environment our children grow up in this environment they are constantly exposed to television programs and movie entertainment which depict the most seamy and perverse side of life they are barraged with slogans and advertising designed to induce them to practices that rob them of spirituality even some textbooks and teaching aids used in our public school systems present theory and in some instances falsehood as truth some fathers leave solely to the mother or to the school the responsibility of shaping a childs ideas and standards too often television and movie screens shape our childrens values we should not assume that public schools always reinforce teachings given in the home concerning ethical and moral conduct we have seen introduced into many school systems false ideas about the theory of mans development from lower forms of life teachings that there are no absolute moral values repudiation of all beliefs regarded as supernatural permissiveness about sexual freedom that gives sanction to immoral behavior and alternative lifestyles such as lesbianism homosexuality and other perverse practices such teachings not only tend to undermine the faith and morals of our young people but they deny the existence of god who gave absolute laws and the divinity of jesus christ surely we can see the moral contradiction of some who argue for the preservation of endangered species but sanction the abortion of unborn humans there is a solution and it is that the lord expects great things from the fathers of israel fathers must take time to find out what their children are being taught and then take steps to correct false information and teaching i know fathers who inquire of their children each evening to determine firsthand what their children are being taught in school and what needs to be corrected then if necessary they instruct them in what the lord has revealed this is application of the principle that light and truth forsake that evil one dc 9337 the new consolidated sunday meeting schedule has been implemented to give fathers more time on the sabbath to teach their children this is a golden opportunity for families to study the scriptures and receive instruction from their parents blessed is the household that does this on a consistent basis what should we teach the lord has revealed the specific curriculum that parents should teach hear his words teach unto your children that all men everywhere must repent or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of god for no unclean thing can dwell there or dwell in his presence moses 657 as further noted in this revelation the fundamental doctrines consist of the doctrine of the fall the mission of christ and his atonement and the first principles and ordinances of the gospel which include faith in christ repentance baptism for the remission of sins and the gift of the holy ghost as the means to a sanctified life see moses 65859 brethren we are to teach the fundamental doctrines of the church in such a way that our children may understand some fathers teach but their children do not understand this places responsibility on fathers to study and learn the gospel with few exceptions righteous sons and daughters who have attained eternal blessings are not just physically begotten by their fathers they are spiritually regenerated by the examples and teachings of their fathers great fathers lead their children to christ third set in order your own household such was the lords counsel to fathers in early church history and such is his timely counsel to us today setting your home in order is keeping the commandments of god this brings harmony and love in the home between you and your companion and between you and your children it is daily family prayer it is teaching your family to understand the gospel of jesus christ it is each family member keeping the commandments of god it is you and your companion being worthy to receive a temple recommend all family members receiving the ordinances of exaltation and your family being sealed together for eternity it is being free from excessive debt with family members paying honest tithes and offerings fathers are your homes in order in a revelation given to president john taylor the lord directed this message to the priesthood i call upon the heads of families to put their houses in order according to the law of god and to purify themselves before me and to purge out iniquity from their households and i will bless and be with you saith the lord and ye shall gather together in your holy places wherein ye assemble to call upon me and ye shall ask for such things as are right and i will hear your prayers and my spirit and power shall be with you and my blessing shall rest upon you upon your families your dwellings and your households upon your flocks and herds and fields your orchards and vineyards and upon all that pertains to you and you shall be my people and i will be your god for my word shall go forth and my work shall be accomplished and my zion shall be established revelation given through president john taylor at salt lake city utah territory october 13th 1882 typeset ms in church historical department archives pp 23 yes these times require great things from fathers and so does the lord three requirements are create a home where love and the spirit of the lord may abide bring up children in light and truth and set your homes in order the sacred title of father is shared with the almighty in the church men are called and released did you ever hear of a mortal father being released as i travel throughout the church and see faithful families i say thank god for exemplary fathers and mothers as i see faithful young people and am proud of their accomplishments i say thank god for diligent fathers and mothers fatherhood is not a matter of station or wealth it is a matter of desire diligence and determination to see ones family exalted in the celestial kingdom if that prize is lost nothing else really matters i know of one family who has as its goal that each member of the family and posterity will arrive in their heavenly homethe celestial kingdomwith no vacant chairs that is their objective they review it at every family reunion and mention it frequently as they mingle together between reunions god bless all the fathers in israel to do well the work within the walls of our own homes with the lords help we shall succeed in this our most important responsibility in the name of jesus christ amen
