the governing ones by elder william r bradford of the first quorum of the seventy imageelder william r bradford my dear brethren this is a thrilling hour at no time has there been a gathering such as this of the elect sons of god were it not for the power of the spirit i could not bear up the weight of this moment i feel impressed to express my profound love for you my brethren my confidence in you can only be compared to my confidence in the master whom we follow the knowledge that we are brothers brings me great joy i would never criticize you but because i love you and because we are brothers i feel i can talk openly and directly to you the fact that you bear the priesthood is not a casual matter it manifests that you have passed through the waters of baptism you have been interviewed by israels judges and found qualified to be gods governing ones your status as the governing ones has been and remains conditional upon compliance with the terms set forth by the father and his son jesus christ in our premortal life you accepted those terms then and by virtue of your ordination and present worthiness you have accepted them here nothing about this is casual it is serious business it is so serious that gods affairs on earth and the salvation of all mankind rest upon it in order that you might understand more fully what it means to be the governing ones let me point out your involvement in governing the church at three levels the individual the family and the formal institutional church you as an individual are the church the lord made a covenant with his faithful sons that they would become the church and kingdom and the elect of god dc 8434 italics added you then through your faithfulness as a priesthood bearer become the church the church will be governed only as you govern yourself the most basic fundamental principle of truth that upon which the entire plan of god is founded is free agency as an individual you have the right to govern yourself it is divinely given to you to think and act as you wish it is your decision it must be pointed out however that although you have the free agency to choose for yourself you do not have the right to choose what will be the result of your decision the results of what you think and do are governed by law good returns good evil returns evil you govern yourself by subjecting yourself to the discipline of law if you are obedient to gods law you remain free you progress and are perfected if you are disobedient to gods law you bind yourself to that which restricts your progress you become defiled and unworthy to be an associate with those who are more clean and pure let me project this principle of governing oneself into your life just a little i dont think it would surprise you to hear that a very high number of both aaronic and melchizedek priesthood bearers as well as our sisters are exercising their free agency in such a way that they have developed extensive television habits many have reached twenty hours or more a week gods plan dictates that we spend our time on this earth engaged in work work means putting yourself mentally and physically into action many hours a week of being indoctrinated by television much of which is satanic hardly seems to fill this requirement even if television were not filled with foolishness violence immorality and filth its entertainment value would still not justify the time drain you are here to work to govern the lords affairs not to be entertained the apostle paul talked straight when he wrote to titus and said unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled they profess that they know god but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate titus 11516 holding the priesthood means being commissioned by the lord to act as he would act if he were here personally is your television habit compatible with that holy commission if you have a twentyhouraweek television habit and would repent and convert it into a gospelstudy habit in one year you could read the book of mormon the doctrine and covenants the pearl of great price and the entire bible in addition you could read jesus the christ the articles of faith gospel principles the basic priesthood manual the basic womens manual the basic childrens manual all three volumes of doctrines of salvation the miracle of forgiveness the promised messiah and essentials in church history and could then reread the bible book of mormon doctrine and covenants and pearl of great price this would still leave time to read the ensign the new era and the friend each month and the church news each week this is based on your ability to read only ten pages an hour the average person can read twenty pages or more an hour if you are average this leaves you with ten hours a week to govern yourself in other kingdombuilding activities such as keeping a personal journal genealogy and temple work improved home teaching welfare services civic and patriotic involvement to protect our freedom and much more i repeat unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled they profess that they know god but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate titus 11516 each of you is a member of the most basic unit of the church the family some of you are not yet fathers but are in preparation to become so as a father you have the divine right and the divine responsibility to govern your family after a pattern set forth by the lord since the family is the basic unit of the church as the family is governed so is the church governed the lord expects you to govern a home and familycentered gospelliving system the challenge of governing the family is to so love teach and motivate its members that their personal decisions will be to unite one with another in the common purpose of following gods plan fundamental to this is developing faith in the lord jesus christ without faith no individual will respond positively to the pattern of life christ taught faith in christ is developed by fasting and prayer which brings spiritual communion and by studying christs teaching as contained in the holy scriptures as faith begins to develop and christs pattern for life begins to be understood by the individual the need to understand and follow the steps of repentance will also become evident since some of the decisions of the family members will be wrong and will stop their progress and defile them there must be a way for them to be cleansed and put back on the proper course they will need to know how to recognize sins of both commission and omission and be so spiritually in tune because of their faith and confidence in christ that they feel remorse for that sin they must know the process of confession and be motivated to make restitution and to resolve to abandon the sin the natural product of an individual who is developing faith in christ and is living the steps of repentance is that he will strive to keep the commandments the actions of his life will become more christlike a christlike person will be united with other family members and will render service to them how then do you govern the family by virtue of the priesthood by persuasion by longsuffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned by kindness and pure knowledge which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy and without guile reproving betimes with sharpness when moved upon by the holy ghost dc 1214143 you teach fasting and prayer you teach the doctrine contained in the holy scriptures and encourage individual private study of them on a regular basis you involve yourself in and teach the steps of repentance you obey the commandments and teach them you serve one another the pattern of a home and familycentered gospelliving system is then established faith in christ repentance keeping the commandments and rendering service to one another this system meets all of the temporal and spiritual needs of the family members at every age level the formal organization of the church consists of a divine orderly system by which we as individuals and as families can meet together in an organized way to be taught gods plan for our salvation take upon ourselves covenants and administer the saving ordinances to one another using priesthood power and authority this is the institutional church it organizes the volunteer services of the members of the church into programs and auxiliaries designed to be a resource to individuals and families these programs and auxiliaries are to be governed by and be auxiliary to the priesthood members called to serve in them should submit to this government these programs should never become powers unto themselves if they do we create a chapelcentered gospelliving system rather than a home and familycentered gospelliving system this is not the lords way he has taught the process his charge is to teach expound exhort baptize and watch over the church visit the house of each member and exhort them to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties be with and strengthen them and see that there is no iniquity in the church neither hardness with each other neither lying backbiting nor evil speaking and also see that all the members do their duty see dc 205051 5355 as the governing ones make no mistake about it this decree was made to the priesthood we love and need the auxiliaries they are staffed by great faithful servants but the very name by which they are called auxiliary which means helper should make it clear to us that the full weight of governing the church rests squarely upon the priesthood if an individual or a family needs help in the process that will bring about their temporal and spiritual salvation it is the responsibility of the priesthood as the priesthood needs help in this work and it will it will call upon the resources of the auxiliaries the time must quickly come when as the governing ones we fully shoulder our responsibility as the shepherds of israel our work must not be done by the restrictions of the calendar or as convenient to the schedule of our habits but on a need basis brethren in some things there remains a considerable distance between what we are and what we should become that we may understand and fulfill our roles as the governing ones in lockstep with our living prophet who is the mouthpiece of god i plead in the name of jesus christ the master amen
