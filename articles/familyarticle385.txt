strengthening the familythe basic unit of the church by president spencer w kimball president of the church imagepresident spencer w kimball my beloved brethren its a joy to meet with you this conference session before beginning i should like to express my personal appreciation to this great body of men who have sung so melodiously to us this evening as we announced to the regional representatives yesterday we meet together often in the church in conferences to worship the lord to feast upon the word of christ and to be built up in faith and testimony we hold ward stake area and general conferences among others in recent years some of our most inspirational conferences have been the area conferences held outside the united states we plan beginning in 1979 to hold some area conferences in the united states through these area conferences more members of the church will be able to meet and hear the general authorities two members of the council of the twelve and others will attend each conference to ease the burdens of time travel and money upon members of the church we have also decided beginning in 1979 to hold only two stake conferences each year in each stake one of these will be attended by one or more general authorities and the other by the regional representative this will leave more time for stake presidents and other local leaders to do more in perfecting the saints and now my beloved brethren may i say something about the great priesthood responsibility of fulfilling our role of patriarch in the home this role becomes more vital with each passing day as new challenges to the strength and sanctity of the home arise the family is the basic unit of the kingdom of god on earth the church can be no healthier than its families no government can long endure without strong families never before have there been so many insidious influences threatening the family as today around the world many of these evil influences come right into the homethrough television radio magazines newspapers and other forms of literature brethren as patriarchs in your homes be worthy watchmen be concerned about the types of programs your family is watching on television or hearing on radio there is so much today that is unsavory and degrading so much that gives the impression that the old sins of sodom and gomorrah are the in thing to do today there are magazines today publishing pictures and articles which likewise beckon to the baser instincts of men and women and young people there are newspapers around the world which seeking greater circulation boldly flaunt sex some of our newspapers continue to publish illustrated advertisements which are basely provocative inviting their readers to pornographic motion pictures it is in such advertisements and motion pictures where seeds are sown for rape unfaithfulness and the most repulsive of deviant sexual transgressions brethren be vigilant on what enters your home through the printed word as well as the electronic media guard against radio and tv programs that degrade see that only good reading material enters your home subscribe to magazines which enrich the mind and uplift the soul there are many good magazines including our own church periodicals the ensign new era and friend in some of the large cities of the world such as london paris tokyo new york and sao paulo there are a number of daily newspapers from which to make a choice bring to your home that newspaper which is most compatible with the teachings and standards of the church here in salt lake city the world headquarters of the church we are also concerned certainly a powerful force in helping this city and state achieve its high standards has been the deseret news this newspaper has been a defender of our convictions relative to such moral issues as liquor pornography and abortion it is vital to a safe clean city and state which are the heart of our growing worldwide church as the deseret news with the church news strengthens our city and state our newspaper can also strengthen the homes of you brethren residing in this area of the world headquarters of the church brethren by being alert to what enters your home you can do much in helping your family seek that which is virtuous lovely or of good report or praiseworthy a of f 113 i had a note one day from a little boy who said i know a man who is such a wonderful man and his name is the bishop we always had a good bishop we always loved him there was bishop zundel and bishop moody and bishop tyler and bishop wilkins i loved all my bishops i hope all my young brethren love their bishops as i did it is a real joy to meet with you priesthood members at this important time of the year a time when we think of our savior jesus christ and his accomplishments and his service and his example and his great program he gave to moses this for behold this is my work and my gloryto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man moses 139 i take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the leaders of the organizations and all who serve in this great cause of priesthood activity for their devotion and strength and power and influence which is worldwide and affects the lives of numerous people i have been trying to think of the ways in which my life has been influenced by the youth organizations i cannot remember when i began but it seems to me like i can remember going to the old robinson hall in thatcher arizona almost as early as i could walk it was only two blocks from our home and we could walk to and from it and we crossed the union canal time and again this big robinson hall was a brick building of rectangular shape and an allpurpose building for the community dances for the sunday school and primary for all church services for the funerals for celebrations and for everything that went on in our little rural town one night this great building caught fire and i remember the lighted sky and the columns of smoke and the consternation and excitement for all of us for a big fire like this attracted the entire town and all came hurrying with their buckets to help put out the fire we had no fire department but all men and their sons rushed across the town at the earliest call of fire he who gave the leadership sent all the men and boys to the canal bank and lined them back to back toward the burning building standing on the bank of the canal the first man drew a bucket full of water and handed the full bucket to another man and he to another and back to the crackling flames in the building the last man doused the bucket of water on the flames many buckets of water were thrown on the fire but the fire was gaining and finally the walls stood out as blackened sentinels and we returned to our homes saddened and defeated it was many years before the fire department was organized in our little town this was the same canal in which i was later baptized into the church and this is the same canal from which i hauled water to the trees and plant life about our home i was the smallest of the boys so i was given this work we called the transportation a lizard did any of you ever see a lizard we made it with a yshaped tree limb in the center we fastened a barrel and hitched one horse to the lizard i drove it to the canal where i dipped up barrels full of canal water then drove the horse one block to the home where i dipped out the water for the plants and flowers my father made a great effort to surround the new home with every kind of flower and save them in those late summer days when water was so scarce it was also my job to drive the horses and cows to the canal for their drinking water sometimes the late summer rains would wash out the dams and leave all the valley dry and the canals all dry then the older boys my brothers answered the call to rush up to the headwaters of the canal with their teams and scrapers and wagons to haul rocks and brush and gravel to fill up the dam again to divert the water from the river to the farms and homes years later we learned to make the sausage dams the sausage dam was a long wire mesh filled with rocks to fill the water holes of the river and divert the river water back into the canal nearly all the boys and girls were baptized in that famous old union canal the allred hall a frame structure on main street two blocks north of robinson hall was used for many purposes and i can remember going there to sunday school and primary as a little boy and to sacrament meeting for it was here that i was confirmed as a member of the church we moved again to the old allred hall and then to the academy building which was our educational institution and headquarters for the polysophical society meetings as well as all community and church meetings for thatcher was populated almost entirely by members of the church then in 1902 we broke ground for a new stake and ward building in thatcher and i gave two dollars from my nickels and dimes for the building i remember they dug a great excavation and then there was a long delay before enough more funds could be gathered to construct the building this was on the way to the post office and the stores where i was often sent to get coal oil for the lamps and for mail and to take the eggs and other things that my abilities made possible i would always run down into the bottom of this great excavation hole and then up the other side but when the weeds began to grow big in this enclosed area and i once saw some skunks there i bypassed the excavation for i had no interest in skunks as pets or as companions when the new stake buildingwhich still stands and is being used for stake and ward purposeswas completed it had just two large rectangular areas one for the meetinghouse on the top floor and one for recreation the latter being the basement i remember we had wires strung across the building and cloth curtains between the classes we could hear something of nearly every class that was going on and even sometimes see if the lights were just right i remember some years later when we of the basketball team of the gila academy did our practicing here and played our games and i always took more than my share of the credit for the fact that in this smaller building with some obstructions we defeated some high school and college teams while we were but a high school team i remember some of the teachers we always went to priesthood meeting on monday nights and we deacons would congregate around the potbellied stove and there receive our instructions i remember some excellent teachers in orville allen and leroi c snow and others in that place and also formed some excellent friendships among other young men of my age leroi c snow of salt lake city was there in the bank and he intrigued us as we became deacons with his many stories of the red sea and the crossing of the red sea by the children of israel and jerusalem where he had been i remember going to sunday school and i believe that i received a great deal of inspiration for the foundation of my life in this place we had opening exercises in the chapel above and then went downstairs to our classwork i remember some of the teachers who came so devotedly and consistently to give us the word and they taught me many things which are basic to my acquaintance with the church programs and the doctrines my mother had a good voice and played the organ and she and my oldest sister clare sang duets i inherited a little of the love for music from her so i was always interested in the singing of the songs and i generally raised my voice and sang lustily i remember the song we meet again in sabbath school hymns no 193 and we did meet again and again and again all my life and i remember when my mother died up in salt lake city when i was eleven there had been a goal set for us to attend sunday school every sunday of the year she died in october i had never missed a sunday school since the first of january i had been present every week and i had a difficult time to square myself with myself to miss the sunday that her body lay in state in our home i really didnt understand then how hard these teachers labored to teach us and how grateful i am for the great army of teachers in all the organizations of the church who are so devoted and untiring to teach the children of zion and then if sometimes we had forgotten the verses we could all join lustily in singing the chorus of the songs join in the jubilee mingle in song join in the joy of the sabbath school throng hymns no 177 the song love at home hymns no 169 we sang in our home evenings which the kimball family always held in the early days of this century i remember the song in our lovely deseret which sister eliza r snow wrote she composed many of our songs i can remember how lustily we sang hark hark hark tis childrens music childrens voices o how sweet when in innocence and love like the angels up above they with happy hearts and cheerful faces meet sing with me no b24 i am not sure how much innocence and love we had but i remember we sang it even straining our little voices to reach the high e which was pretty high for childrens voices i remember we sang that the children may live long and be beautiful and strong i wanted to live a long time and i wanted to be beautiful and strongbut never reached it tea and coffee and tobacco they despise and i learned to despise them there were people in our rural community who were members of the church who sometimes used tea and coffee and sometimes tobacco the song goes on drink no liquor and they eat but a very little meat i still dont eat very much meat they are seeking to be great and good and wise and then wed hark hark hark again when in innocence and love like the angels up above and then the third verse went they should be instructed young how to watch and guard the tongue and their tempers train and evil passions bind they should always be polite and treat evrybody right and in evry place be affable and kind and then wed hark hark hark again they must not forget to pray night and morning evry day for the lord to keep them safe from evry ill and assist them to do right that with all their mind and might they may love him and may learn to do his will and then wed sing hark hark hark again i was never quite sure whether the angels were limited in their voice culture as we were but we were glad to take the credit one of the songs that has disappeared was number 163 dont kill the little birds and i remember many times singing with a loud voice dont kill the little birds that sing on bush and tree all thro the summer days their sweetest melody dont shoot the little birds the earth is gods estate and he provideth food for small as well as great deseret songs 1909 no 163 i had a sling and i had a flipper i made them myself and they worked very well it was my duty to walk the cows to the pasture a mile away from home there were large cottonwood trees lining the road and i remember that it was quite a temptation to shoot the little birds that sing on bush and tree because i was a pretty good shot and i could hit a post at fifty yards distance or i could hit the trunk of a tree but i think perhaps because i sang nearly every sunday dont kill the little birds i was restrained the second verse goes dont kill the little birds their plumage wings the air their trill at early morn makes music evrywhere what tho the cherries fall half eaten from the stem and berries disappear in garden field and glen this made a real impression on me so i could see no great fun in having a beautiful little bird fall at my feet and then there was the song that evan stephens wrote the mormon boy and how proud i was when we were to sing in the congregation a mormon boy a mormon boy i am a mormon boy i might be envied by a king for i am a mormon boy i liked this song i have always gloried in those words i might be envied by a king for i am a mormon boy i liked the song what shall the harvest be because it gave us a chance to sing in parts my beloved brethren as i close i bear testimony to you that i hold the priesthood you hold the priesthood this is the priesthood that elijah held and the prophets peter james and john also they and their associates held the priesthood but without the sealing power we could do nothing for there would be no validity to that which we do thats the thing that counts that is why elijah came that is why moses came for he conferred upon the head of peter james and john in that dispensation these privileges and these powers these keys that they might go forth and perform this labor that is why they came to the prophet joseph smith and the lord said i will send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord mal 45 why should he send elijah because he held the keys of the authority to administer in all the ordinances of the priesthood and without the authority that is given the ordinances could not be administered in righteousness salvation could not come to this world without the mediation of jesus christ how shall god come to the rescue of the generations he will send elijah the prophet the law revealed to moses in horeb never was revealed to the children of israel as a nation elijah shall reveal the covenants to seal the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers the anointing and sealing is to be called elected and the election made sure i know that god lives i know that jesus christ lives said john taylor my predecessor for i have seen him i bear this testimony to you brethren in the name of jesus christ amen
