we have been there all the time by elder paul h dunn of the presidency of the first quorum of the seventy imageelder paul h dunn thank god for the youth of the church i dont know where we could have a better object lesson than this delightful group behind me president richards always hits a sensitive note i have thought through that parable of the talents many times and have read it perhaps a little differently than you have the lord said when we do what we are supposed to do well done good and faithful servant matt 2521 in my case he might well say well dunn on behalf of the presidency of the first quorum of the seventy we greet these three new brethren to our quorum as i travel around the church and see many of the challenges and as i have listened very carefully in this conference and in other meetings i appreciate more fully the concern of our president to reach out to those who are lost or inactive he made a very interesting point in an earlier service a very interesting observation and i would like to quote it he said prevention is far better than redemption did you get the difference prevention is far better than redemption would you young adults young married couples young people everywhere please take note while my daughters were growing up during the many trips we took in our car the most oftenasked question was when will we get there dad and how long will it take i couldnt help but think that those questions are much like some that we adults ask we think we will be happy when we arrive at a certain destination our schooling is finished we get a better job we arrive at a certain income the baby is born our bills are paid we recover from our illness we own a new car some disagreeable task is finished we retire or we are free from all responsibility my father used to teach us that life is a journey not a camp and he indicated that too many people are camping id like to challenge all of us particularly the young people and young couples that are married to see life as a whole and to enjoy the marvelous journey i remember a grandmother who had been widowed early in her life and was moving out of her home her granddaughter about to be married herself was carefully helping her pack the boxes of dishes and the faded towels see that sewing machine over there in the corner the grandmother asked your grandfather always left his hat there when he came home in the evening i used to scold him all the time about it just put your hat on the hook id say why does your hat always have to be on the sewing machine messing everything up then one day he got pneumonia and died leaving four little children and me to miss him for a lifetime how many times through the years ive thought what id give to see that hat on the sewing machine placed there by his own hand like the grandmother in this story we too often let trifles cloud our vision we get caught up in nonessentials or in a multitude of meetings both in and out of the church that have no particular meaning or purpose we sometimes nag the people we love the best over little inattentions small faults mere nothings in the whole scheme of things instead of treasuring the alltoorare moments we share with our dear ones we pick at faults imagined or otherwise how many of us say to our wives our husbands our children why cant you do this why dont you do that or someday when i have the time our last daughter left for college this past month and the eighteen years of daily living with her were suddenly over where had they gone what minute what hour what day or night had swallowed up all those joyous giggling growingup years the first night she was away i slipped into her bedroom looked at her record player and thought of all those times i had mechanically said would you turn down the music and i thought too how often in the days ahead wed be longing to hear the music thank god she and her parents have many wonderful memories to savor in the years ahead our daughter janet lies in a hospital bed at this very moment and she and we know what great moments we have to share and you know janet our great faith and our feeling why do those sudden moments of clarity when we realize how precious our loved ones are come so rarely how do we let ourselves get caught up in faultfinding digging or scolding at those who are nearest our hearts is it ever worth it as c s lewis once advised take care it is so easy to break eggs without making omelettes cited in richard l evans richard evans quote book salt lake city publishers press 1971 p 169 maybe each of us needs to stop amidst our busy dashing breathless liveseven amidst our many meetings it recalls to mind an experienceperhaps you know itof a little inquisitive boy who came to church with his father and as they walked into the foyer the boy noticed the usual trophy case over which were placed several large plaques curiosity got to the little boy he pulled on his dads coattail and said dad whats that one the father moved a little closer and read the inscription patted his boy on the head and said son thats a plaque honoring those who died in the service to which the little boy said morning or evening i appreciate that the lord has instructed us that there are important meetings but then there are other meetings which are not well planned or properly structured yes even amidst our meetings and our commitments we need to really see to see the way his eyes wrinkle when he laughs see the tilt of her head as the light catches her hair remember his dash of humor maybe when things get in the saddle and ride us we need to step back for a moment of clarity we need to remember why we are doing all of thisremember how much we love those we love a young mother was running late to a very important meeting one time as she dashed from her bedroom her little threeyearold stopped her and said mommy mom to which the mother replied cant you see im busy mom i need to tell you something not now said the mother with an impatient wave of her hand mom began the little girl again oh what is it said the mother i just wanted to tell you i love you well life is fleeting at best we turn around and were young turn around again and were old minutes rush past we cant stop them in all their rush were eighteen were twentyeight were fortyeight were gray is there ever enough time to nag scold dig or complain at the people we love most we fool ourselves if we think there is theres only time to stop as one has put it to smell the flowers do you remember julia ward howe who told a senator on one occasion i am in need of help for a very special person julia i am so busy he said i can no longer concern myself with individuals she replied thats remarkable even god hasnt reached that stage yet see richard evans quote book p 165 concern yourself first with individuals with relationships with loved ones what else really matters dont imagine yourself regardless of who you are busier than the lord who puts souls first above everything else the other night i was flying home from a distant conference i had been away only three days but as the flood lights of the airport loomed up i welled up with anticipation and excitement i felt as though i could have been a great hero returning from spaceand what caused this excitement i was going back to my family does it have to take flights away from home a child leaving for college or the death of a husband who will never again leave his hat in an awkward place to remind us how sweet are the moments with our loved ones and friends how brief they are in the run of time does it take these things to stop us in our picking at trifling faults to realize the beauty of every minute together when will we be there how long will it take how much longer dad will it take are questions often asked by impatient children when will i arrivea question asked by adults as they face the pressures of life for all of us let it not take a lifetime before we realize that we have been there all along that life does not offer anything sweeter than the love of dear ones and the sharing of time together you remember what president kimball said prevention is far better than redemption god grant us the wisdom to know that life is a great journey and may we have the sense to enjoy it i bear witness to these truths in the holy name of jesus christ amen
