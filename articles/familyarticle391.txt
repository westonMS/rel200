a report and a challenge by president spencer w kimball president of the church imagepresident spencer w kimball this is the semiannual general conference of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints and we bid you welcome you who are in attendance and you who are listening over radio and television and we extend to you our love and our appreciation since august of last year we have held twentysix solemn assemblies for the priesthood leadership in various regions of the united states and canada in which we have reminded the brethren of their responsibilities and their opportunities we have met about 28000 of the leading brethren in those stakes and missions we recently held area conferences at which we have met some 151000 of our members of the church since we began holding area conferences we have spoken of the gospel and its blessings to nearly a half million 446691 people in many countries in general we have found the church is healthy and moving forward we glory with you in the advancement made to 764 stakes and 146 missions and about 9000 wards and branches and we feel that the lord is blessing our extended efforts in the numerous new stakes created all over the world new young and vigorous leadership has been ordained and set apart to look after the interests of the people we are delighted with the way these local officials accept this new responsibility the young missionaries have continued to proliferate and we now have in excess of 25000 missionaries mostly young elders of nineteen to twentyone with some young women and older couples we are grateful to announce that success has followed their efforts and an estimated 117000 converts will have been added to the rolls they are happy in their new responsibilities as they have found a new spiritual home and have learned more concerning our heavenly father his son and his program we have about 183000 youth in seminary and 88000 or more in institute or a total of more than a quarter million including youth of every land and about 8000 indians and hundreds of thousands of other lamanites by the end of this year we shall approach the four million mark in church membership it is estimated that it took 117 years from 1830 to 1947 to attain one million members then it took sixteen years from 1947 to 1963 to reach the second million members and then nine years 1963 to 1972 to attain the third million it will probably take about four or five years to move up to the four million mark and then we can guess what the future holds what does this mean to us it means that if the members of the church do real proselyting in their home wards that the number of converts could grow to astronomical figures and even hasten the time when the lord will be returning to the earth in his second advent we are very gratified with the growth of the church both numerically and spiritually i can remember when we were getting only about 19 percent attendance at sacrament meetings of course that included all members of the church children and infants but it was very low today many stakes and missions have reached nearly 50 and 60 percent of their total membership in attendance at sacrament meetings and there are many units that have a much higher attendance record since our last conference we have had a delightful message from christopher s bond governor of the state of missouri who advised us that he has rescinded the 138yearold executive order of governor lilburn w boggs calling for the extermination or expulsion of the mormons from the state of missouri governor bond present missouri governor writes expressing on behalf of all missourians our deep regret for the injustice and undue suffering which was caused by this 1838 order i hereby rescind executive order no 44 dated october 27 1838 issued by governor lilburn w boggs to governor bond and the people of missouri we extend our deep appreciation for this reversal and for the present friendly associations between the membership of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints and the people of missouri as it is now in effect in missouri now we have five stakes in fiftyone communities with approximately 15000 members of the church who we are confident are lawabiding citizens of that state of missouri thank you governor bond gardens our pride is great in the people who have listened and who have planted gardens and orchards and trees in the past months from all directions we hear of gardens which have made an outstanding contribution a couple in alabama wrote we had vegetables all during the year we feel it saved us quite a bit of money one authority estimates there will be about 35 million home vegetable gardens this year up from about 325 million last year and he says that probably 41 percent of all american households will do some home canning this year as against 37 percent a year ago many of the numerous gardens are found in hanging baskets in containers on stairways on trellises and in window boxes in oklahoma a state university makes 240 plots available to married students in long island some 400 plots have been turned over to residents in pennsylvania some 200000 plots were under cultivation one authority says i have my own garden and have found its my sanity away from work we would add to the gardenorchard project the clearing of yards and homes we have mentioned it before still there are numerous homes with brokendown fences and barns outbuildings that could probably be torn down or rebuilt ditch banks that could be cleared we congratulate all who have listened and followed counsel from frankfurt germany this comes we are two families in the frankfurt mission and we tell you about our garden it was not very easy to find a piece of land in a large city like frankfurtit is a tiny gardenand when we rented it it looked like a wilderness with a broken fence a broken cottage and wild grass all over it did not discourage us first we made a new fence repaired the cottage and digged the whole garden in the springtime we planted vegetables and the neighbours told us that it would not grow there is a little stream where we can go on our bikes hanged with cans and this way we carry our water we prayed to the lord that he would bless our garden the lord did answer our prayers every kind of vegetable came it is so wonderful to see the plants grow we take turns now to go to our garden and water our plants we are happy to have a garden pornography members of the church everywhere are urged to not only resist the widespread plague of pornography but as citizens to become actively and relentlessly engaged in the fight against this insidious enemy of humanity around the world last year billions of dollars were spent worldwide on obscene motion pictures and literature this smut is surfacing in bookstores magazine shops motion picture theaters and unfortunately in some department stores food markets and even drugstores we urge latterday saints to get involved as citizens and fight obscenity we quote from an article in a national magazine after years of inertia more and more us cities are cracking down on sexoriented businesses tougher local laws many of them stemming from recent rulings by the supreme court are at work against smut and vice a high court ruling upheld the right of cities and counties to use zoning to eliminate adult motion pictures war on pornography begins in earnest us news and world report sept 13 1976 p 75 pornography degrades sex and humanity sex is an extremely delicate part of our human relationships when you assault that and degrade it you make it an animalistic act and it is an assault on our humanity generally as that spreads it has an overall effect on our population obscenity is counter to civilization it attacks our basic beliefs its an attack on the family ethic larry parrish us assistant attorney in war on pornography p 76 to moses the lord as recorded in leviticus spoke plainly and forcefully against adultery in various forms whorings and homosexuality the lord told moses these things were an abomination lev 20 they are still an abomination they still corrode the mind snuff out selfesteem and drag one down into the darkness of anguish and unhappiness and so we say to you teach your children to avoid smut as the plague it is as citizens join in the fight against obscenity in your communities do not be lulled into inaction by the pornographic profiteers who say that to remove obscenity is to deny people the rights of free choice do not let them masquerade licentiousness as liberty precious souls are at stakesouls that are near and dear to each of us sins spawned by pornography unfortunately perpetuate other serious transgressions including abortion abortion abortion with all its heartaches to say nothing of the destruction of life continues to rise alarmingly last year in the united states alone there were reported over one million legal abortions that is nearly fifty times the number only seven years before in 1969 one leading authority estimates that by 1980 there may be 24 million legal abortions abortions in many other countries are running similarly high abortion the taking of life is one of the most grievous of sins we have repeatedly affirmed the position of the church in unalterably opposing all abortions except in two rare instances when conception is the result of forcible rape and when competent medical counsel indicates that a mothers health would otherwise be seriously jeopardized certainly the tragedy of abortion often begins with a visit to an xrated motion picture theater or fingering through an obscene magazine the path to the grievous sins of fornication adultery and homosexuality can begin too with the viewing of some of the sex and violenceoriented programs now being shown on television including network television we must put on the armor of righteousness and resist with all our might these satanic influences the time is now when members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints must take a stand fearlessly and relentlessly for the lords ways as opposed to those of satan bicentennial we have recently celebrated the notable event of the bicentennial with all other good people of this country we have experienced an increase of loyalty to our precious land we remember benjamin franklin said i have lived sir a long time and the longer i live the more convincing proofs i see of this truth that god governs in the affairs of men i firmly believe this that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of babel james parton life and times of benjamin franklin boston james r osgood and company 1864 257374 out of years of turmoil and tragedy wars and riots assassinations and wrongdoings in high places americans have recaptured the spirit of 1776 we again had visions of our revolutionary founders and our immigrant ancestors great and consoling is the vision of free men and free women enjoying limited government and unlimited opportunity and as we move forward from the bicentennial we state with john adams in the carving over the marble fireplace in the white house may none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof no government can remain strong by ignoring the commandments given to moses on mount sinai honesty today is the day to preach honesty and integrity many people have seemingly lost their concept of the godgiven law of honesty joseph smith led us in saying we believe in being honest true chaste benevolent virtuous and in doing good to all men a of f 113 our creator said in the carved message on sinai thou shalt not steal again it was reiterated in the basis of the restoration thou shalt not steal dc 596 in public office and private lives the word of the lord thunders thou shalt not steal nor do anything like unto it dc 596 we find ourselves rationalizing in all forms of dishonesty including shoplifting which is a mean low act indulged in by millions who claim to be honorable decent people dishonesty comes in many other forms in hijacking in playing upon private love and emotions for filthy lucre in robbing money tills or stealing commodities of employers in falsifying accounts in taking advantage of other taxpaying people by misuse of food stamps and false claims in taking unreal exemptions in taking out government or private loans without intent to repay in declaring unjust improper bankruptcies to avoid repayment of loans in robbing on the street or in the home money and other precious possessions in stealing time giving less than a full day of honest labor for a full days compensation in riding public transportation without paying the fare and all forms of dishonesty in all places and in all conditions to all thieveries and dishonest acts the lord says thou shalt not steal four short common words he used perhaps he wearied of the long list he could have made of ways to steal misrepresent and take advantage and he covered all methods of taking that which does not properly belong to one by saying thou shalt not steal everybodys doing it is often given as an excuse no society can be healthy without honesty trust and selfrestraint in family life men must and should be considerate of their wives not only in the bearing of children but in caring for them through childhood the mothers health must be conserved and the husbands consideration for his wife is his first duty and selfcontrol a dominant factor in all their relationships family life is gaining ground some countries are coming to an appreciation for children and family life we note that france has now repudiated that program which would limit life it is said that if a couples combined ages in france do not exceed fiftytwo and one of them is employed the couple can borrow 1350 from the government on demand this is for the payment of rent payment on a home or for household equipment with fifteen months to pay if a french couple has a baby before the loan payment is due their debt is reduced by 15 percent for the first child 25 percent for the second child 25 percent for the third and complete debt forgiveness for the fourth in france the expectant mother is said to receive 150 for prenatal care this is a step in the right direction home evening the family home evening is committed to the belief that the family is the most important institution in all the world we must give preference in time and energy to that family and observe properly and conscientiously the family home evening the father presides in this home evening with his wife assisting and with song and prayer and teachings a solid righteous concept of living is developed in the family the home is the best place to teach the gospel of faith repentance and honesty and integrity and cleanliness the living of the commandments and the close relationship of parents and children will greatly reduce divorces discourage all other forms of evil and misunderstandings the family is the basic school of virtue one cleric wrote indeed where the family is weak or where it has been destroyed as a vital institution the moral breakdown is most obvious man is a weak creature who needs the support of good institutionsthe family church school the fellowship of work etc if the family is the first and essential cell social decay must follow its breakdown an american author wrote this throughout history nations have been able to survive a multiplicity of diseases invasions famines earthquakes epidemics depressions but they have never been able to survive the disintegration of the family the family is the seedbed of economic skills money habits attitude toward work and the art of financial independence it is a stronger agency of educational success than the school and a stronger religious training than the church what strengthened the family strengthened society when the family falters life falls apart from the man who sits in the chair of the president of this country next january there will be high requirements for imagination and courage there may come a generation that will incorporate the basic virtues with the worlds compulsive thrust toward the future we hope that 1976 may be the year in which the nation began to move on to the remaking of itself americas spirit is on the rise us news and world report aug 23 1976 pp 2527 adapted our devotion to this program is attracting the attention of many churches and individuals and groups in the
