priesthoodauthority and power by bishop h burke peterson first counselor in the presiding bishopric imagebishop h burke peterson my brethren im especially grateful for an assignment to speak in this priesthood meeting tonight i imagine this is the greatest assemblage of the priesthood in this dispensation ive wrestled with a way to deliver to you a message i think is of utmost importance and of vital concern to all of our fathers children i have prayed and do now pray for his spirit to attend us i testify to you that what i will say is truth its preparation having been prompted by the spirit may your hearts be open and your spirits receptive spiritual growth and the happiness resulting therefrom is based on an understanding of and obedience to priesthood principles i believe there are many whose lives are clouded with unhappiness because we priesthood brethren have not listened as attentively as we should to the warning voice of the lord as he tells the brethren there are dangers when we misuse the priesthood we have all read the following revelation many times may i read it again and in the process relate it to the daily conduct of our lives quoting from the doctrine and covenants behold there are many called but few are chosen and why are they not chosen because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world and aspire to the honors of men that they do not learn this one lesson listen to the lesson brethren that the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness dc 1213436 from this i understand that there is a difference between priesthood authority and priesthood power power and authority in the priesthood are not necessarily synonymous all of us who hold the priesthood have the authority to act for the lord but the effectiveness of our authorityor if you please the power that comes through that authoritydepends on the pattern of our lives it depends on our righteousness note again the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness may i suggest that many of us have lost sight of one of the most important reasons for our holding the priesthood to be an effective teachers quorum president elders quorum president bishop or counselor is importantwe spend many hours in training these officers to perform the vital priesthood ordinances is essential but even more important than all these is the need to learn how to use the priesthood to bless our families and homes if we live for it ours can be a power given us from our heavenly father that will bring peace to a troubled household ours can be a power that will bless and comfort little children that will bring sleep to tearstained eyes in the wee hours of the morning ours can be the power that will bring happiness to a family home evening the power to calm the unsettled nerves of a tired wife ours can be the power that will give direction to a confused and vulnerable teenager ours the power to bless a daughter before she goes on her first date or before her temple marriage or to bless a son before his departure for a mission or college ours my young brethren can be the power to stop evil thoughts of a group of boys gathered together in vulgar conversation ours can be the power to heal the sick and comfort the lonely these are some of the important purposes of the priesthood when we have the power to bless families in some of the ways mentioned then we are using this godgiven authority for its most exalted purposeto bind family ties and perform priesthood ordinances that will endure through the eternities he who has developed the power and uses it to do the things we have mentioned will honestly consider the righteous desires of his family even though they may not be exactly the same as his he will listen to those in his home with the same attention he would give a priesthood leader he will listeneven to the smallest child he will put his familys welfare ahead of his own comfort he will learn to control himself he will not use a quick temper as an excusehe will rise above it it neednt always be with him he will understand that a soft answer turneth away wrath his voice will never be heard in anger in his home he will never punish in anger as one of his most significant attributes he who has developed this priesthood power will not only by his thoughts but also by his actions give honor respect and dignity to the loveliest of the lords creationshis daughters brethren can you hear the lord counseling his sons can you hear him say to us be careful be wise with this authority i have given you we read further in the doctrine and covenants we have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men as soon as they get a little authority as they suppose they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion hence many are called but few are chosen dc 1213940 many are the brethren who do not understand what these sacred words mean we must not be inconsiderate we must not command we must not be dictators we must not become puffed up in pride i would like to say something about the power of the priesthood as it can bless the lives of women elder john a widtsoe said the priesthood is not bestowed on the basis of mental power but is given to good men woman has her gift of equal magnitude a wiser power than any on earth understands why a spirit in the far off beginning was male or female john a widtsoe priesthood and church government deseret book co 1954 p 90 men are not superior to women however by the very nature of some of the things we do we imply this the fact that a man holds the priesthood and is the presiding officer in the home as well as in church organizations does not in any way make him a superior being the priesthood is a divinely given authority and responsibility which will receive its ultimate fulfillment only when there is a devoted and happy wife at his side note happy is the description of the wife no man will ever be exalted by himself no matter how great his works on the earth brethren we would do well to understand that many of the finest ideas useful in the proper management of a family can come from openly discussing with and seeking counsel from our wives women have a spirit and mental ability that is absolutely essential in strengthening the family relationship it must be nurtured however and drawn upon by the presiding priesthood authority in that home we should be gladdened not threatened by our wives good qualities elder neal a maxwell once said i am grateful for my wifes traits and qualities that excel my own in some critical dimensions of our partnership byu twelvestake fireside jan 4 1976 may i also suggest to you that it is important for the brethren to develop the same concern for the training of girls as they have for the training of the priesthood boys we need only refer to the experience of the 2000 ammonite sons of helaman for an insight into one measure of the capacity of the women i quote from alma now behold there were two thousand of those young men who entered into this covenant and took their weapons of war to defend their country and they were all young men and they were exceedingly valiant for courage and also for strength and activity but behold this was not allthey were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted yea they were men of truth and soberness for they had been taught to keep the commandments of god and to walk uprightly before him now they never had fought yet they did not fear death and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives yea they had been taught by their mothers that if they did not doubt god would deliver them and they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers saying we do not doubt our mothers knew it alma 5318 2021 564748 it seems more than a coincidence to me that when mention is made of all who could be counted as being responsible for the great valor and spirit of these 2000 young men the recorder felt impressed to mention only the training by their mothers many others might have been mentionedmothers were the fact that mothers are one of the keys and secrets to the strength of the aaronic priesthood would lead me to believe that more time must be spent by priesthood leaders in training girls in proper priesthood principles that future aaronic priesthood generations might be as blessed as were helamans 2000 sons it is evident that the brethren of the priesthood are spending a great deal of their time and effort in planning ways to affect the character and spirituality of the priesthood boys this must continue however only a small fraction of this effort is put into the priesthood education and spiritual development of the girls how can we expect in them as fine a product if we do not give them an increase in attention unless girls have had a model and know what priesthood qualities to look for in an eternal companion the consequences may be that many families in generations to come will suffer because of wrong marriage choices this need not be if priesthood brethren will be the appropriate models and give more earnest understanding and energy to the training of the girls and now my brethren in conclusion may i continue in the doctrine and covenants no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood only by persuasion by longsuffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned by kindness and pure knowledge which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy and without guile reproving betimes with sharpness when moved upon by the holy ghost and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved lest he esteem thee to be his enemy that he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men and to the household of faith and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of god and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven the holy ghost shall be thy constant companion and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever dc 1214146 what a beautiful promise blessed is the family that can look to you brethren as the vital conduit joining heaven and home i testify to you that i know that he lives that jesus is the christ in the name of jesus christ amen
