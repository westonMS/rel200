parents teach your children by president paul h dunn of the first council of the seventy imagepresident paul h dunn i am grateful this morning my brothers and sisters for the uplifting and inspired message we have heard from our president as he spoke i thought in my mind that if all the world would heed this counsel most all of its problems would be resolved one of the basic tenets of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints is that we believe in continuous revelation it is our testimony to the world that god communicates to prophets today the same as he did in ancient times gods revelations in times past have been sustained and revered in holy scripture new revelation is the mind and will of the lord through current prophets and when they speak when moved upon by the holy ghost it is the will of the lord the mind of the lord the word of the lord the voice of the lord and the power of god unto salvation dc 684 italics added this morning we heard from a prophet of god and he communicated the mind and will of the lord to all who would listen and receive counsel concerning the importance of such an occasion as this it was president kimball some years ago who made this observation sunday night april 7 the great tabernacle was closed the lights turned out and the record machines stopped the door locked and another historical conference became history it will have been lost motiona waste of time energy and moneyif its messages are not heeded in the seven twohour sessions and in the several satellite meetings truths were taught doctrines expounded exhortations given enough to save the whole world from all its illsand he concluded i mean from all its ills spencer w kimball in the world but not of it speeches of the year provo utah brigham young university press 1968 pp 23 he reaffirmed that in our hearts and minds this morning i remember hearing president kimball just the other day quote from samuel and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle 1 sam 311 today our president has caused our ears to tingle now for a few moments i would like to direct some remarks to parents everywhere in this great listening audience an oftquoted passage of scripture and revelation of the latterday saints is one referred to a few moments ago by president kimball its contained in the doctrine and covenants and again inasmuch as parents have children in zion or in any of her stakes which are organized that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance faith in christ the son of the living god and of baptism and the gift of the holy ghost by the laying on of hands when eight years old the sin be upon the heads of the parents dc 6825 i dont know how many times you have heard this passage of scripture and appropriately so but certainly no counsel could be more timely or pertinent to the problems besetting families throughout the world how many times have parents said to themselves after hearing this message i know its true and i know what the lord expects but how do i do it in other words how do i become an effective teacher of the gospel to my own children as i have thought about this it has been my observation that most parents really want to be good parents most want to do a better job may we consider this morning four things that parents can do that will help them to better achieve success in rearing their children in righteousness first i would itemize the power of parental precept parents teach two ways the first is by preceptor what we say by way of teaching correct principles to our children i am reminded of the father who in gathering his children together one morning asked what would you learn of me the reply came how shall we care for our bodies how shall we play how shall we work together how shall we live with our fellowmen how shall we pray how shall we know god for what ends shall we live and the father pondered these words and sorrow was in his heart for his own life and teaching touched not these things you may recall the old farmer who had quite a reputation for being a philosopher he said you can no more teach what you aint got than you can go back to where you aint been i recall as a young man when i first heard our text quoted from the doctrine and covenants i went to my own mother and exclaimed well mom how does it feel to have all my sins on your head then she taught me the lesson of that passage she said ah paul you forgot to read carefully what the lord said he said that the sin be upon the head of parents if they do not teach their children the principles of the gospel and youve been taught and i had been taught thank the lord for parents who realize their responsibility to instill in their children the principles of the gospel and who follow the counsel of the lords prophets parents in the church today have been counseled to regularly consistently and inspiringly hold family home evenings and to take advantage of other great teaching moments to so acquaint their children the second way would be the power of parental example ralph waldo emerson said what you do thunders so loudly in my ears i cannot hear what you say will you remember this little couplet parents can tell but never teach until they practice what they preach im grateful for the example of a father who as a busy executive of a great supermarket chain still found the time to demonstrate by his concern that groceries were less important than his boy like many young men i once had a paper route and i had to get up early in the morning to deliver them one morning i woke up and looked outdoors to see one of those torrential arkansas downpours i thought we were in for another flood as i prepared to go out in that rain my father came into the room dressed in his business suit get in the car paul he said ill drive you around your route this morning this meant that he would have to go without his own breakfast on that morning in addition to the heavy rain the papers came late by the time we had them delivered it was considerably past the hour that my father had to be to work and on this particular morning he had scheduled a very important board meeting he arrived at the meeting late walked into the board room and announced im sorry im late gentlemen but i had to deliver my papers this morning do you think that there was ever any doubt in my mind as to my fathers greatest concern interestingly i dont recall too many lessons my parents verbally taught but their example is still a part of me till this day third the power of parental love recently i came across a little article by doris jehnke entitled saturday with a teenage daughter it seems all too typical of parentdaughter relationships these days let me share it with you are you going to sleep all day who said you could use my hairspray clean the dishes off the table turn down the radio have you made your bed that skirt is much too short your closet is a mess stand up straight somebody has to go to the store quit chewing your gum like that your hair is too bushy i dont care if everybody else does have one turn down the radio have you done your homework dont slouch you didnt make your bed quit banging on the piano why dont you iron it yourself your fingernails are too long look it up in the dictionary sit up straight get off the phone now why did you ever buy that record take the dog out you forgot to dust that table youve been in the bathroom long enough turn off the radio and get to sleep now another day gone and not once did i say i love you stanley e miller comp especially for mormons kellirae arts provo utah 1971 vol 1 p 141 too often it is easier to criticize to point out the faults than to praise or give love mothers and dads when was the last time you told your children i love you a good friend of mine makes it a point every day to find something positive that he can compliment in his children so that he can truly say i love you will you make the opportunity soon finally the power of parental prayer the book of mormon provides a great example of a father who recovered a lost son by the power of personal prayer the conditions of his time are akin to our own day now it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king benjamin being little children at the time he spake unto his people and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers they did not believe what had been said concerning the resurrection of the dead neither did they believe concerning the coming of christ and now because of their unbelief they could not understand the word of god and their hearts were hardened mosiah 2613 one of these of the rising generation was alma the younger he was a man of many words and did speak much flattery to the people leading away many to do after the manner of his iniquities mosiah 278 we are further told that he was a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of god because of the dissension that he caused mosiah 279 i suppose the tendency then as it often seems to be today was to write him off but you know the miraculous story of how an angel of the lord appeared to that young man and how he became one of the greatest missionaries in the church of christ what was it that caused that great change to occur the angel testified to alma the following behold the lord hath heard the prayers of his people and also the prayers of his servant alma who is thy father mosiah 2714 think of it the power of parental prayer as we consider the challenge of rearing children in a world fraught with temptations false ideologies and materialistic enticements do you not feel the need for guidance and inspiration beyond your human capacity there is no greater help or strength that a father or mother can obtain than through securing that help from the lord just the other day i had a sweet experience i stood in the presence of a mother and a father who had just greeted their longlost son home from the warsi mean the worldly wars what a tender moment i can tell you their prayers were heard and answered remember what alma said counsel with the lord in all thy doings and he will direct thee for good alma 3737 may i testify to all parents in zion everywhere to the efficacy of these great principles in rearing our children righteously the power of precept the power of example the power of love and the power of prayer i add my personal witness that jesus christ really lives that his kingdom is here upon the earth and that this morning we heard from his appointed prophet and servant spencer w kimball may we abide by the counsel and teachings given to us by the lord through his servants i humbly pray as i testify to these things in the name of jesus christ amen
