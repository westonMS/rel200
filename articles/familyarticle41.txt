no greater joy than to know that they know by elder k brett nattress of the seventy imageelder k brett nattress i dont know if anything in this world could bring more happiness and joy than to know that our children know the savior brothers and sisters i have recently been pondering this question if all that your children knew of the gospel came from youas their only sourcehow much would they know this question applies to all those who love mentor and influence children is there any greater gift that we can impart to our children than a memory burned deep into their hearts that we know that our redeemer lives do they know that we know and more important have they come to know for themselves that he lives when i was a boy i was my mothers most difficult young child to raise i had an overabundance of energy my mother tells me that her greatest fear was that i would not live to see adulthood i was just too active i remember as a young boy sitting in one particular sacrament meeting with our family my mother had just received a new set of scriptures this new set combined the entire standard works into one bound edition and in the very center was lined paper for notetaking during the meeting i asked if i could hold her scriptures with the hope of promoting my reverence she handed them down the pew as i perused her scriptures i noticed that she had written a personal goal in the note section to provide context for her goal i must tell you that i am the second of six children and my name is brett my mother had written in red just one goal patience with brett as further evidence to help you understand the challenge my parents faced in raising our family let me tell you about our family scripture reading each morning my mother read the book of mormon to us during breakfast during this time my older brother dave and i would sit quietly but irreverently to be completely honest we werent listening we were reading the print on the cereal boxes finally one morning i decided to square up with my mother i exclaimed mom why are you doing this to us why are you reading the book of mormon every morning i then made a statement that i am embarrassed to admit to in fact i cant believe i actually said it i told her mom i am not listening her loving response was a defining moment in my life she said son i was at a meeting where president marion g romney taught about the blessings of scripture reading during this meeting i received a promise that if i would read the book of mormon to my children every day i would not lose them she then looked me straight in the eyes and with absolute determination said and i will not lose you her words pierced my heart notwithstanding my imperfections i was worth saving she taught me the eternal truth that i am a son of a loving heavenly father i learned that no matter what the circumstance i was worth it this was a perfect moment for an imperfect little boy i am eternally grateful for my angel mother and for all angels who love children perfectly notwithstanding their imperfections i firmly believe that all sistersi will call them angelsare mothers in zion whether or not they are married or bear children during this earthly experience years ago the first presidency proclaimed motherhood is near to divinity it is the highest holiest service to be assumed by mankind it places her who honors its holy calling and service next to the angels1 i am grateful for angels throughout the church who boldly and lovingly proclaim eternal truth to heavenly fathers children i am grateful for the gift of the book of mormon i know that it is true it contains the fulness of the gospel of jesus christ i am unaware of anyone who is diligently reading the book of mormon each day with pure intent and with faith in christ who has lost their testimony and fallen away moronis prophetic promise carries with it the key to know the truth of all thingsincluding having the ability to discern and avoid the deceptions of the adversary see moroni 1045 i am also grateful for a loving heavenly father and for his son jesus christ the savior provided the perfect example of how to live in an imperfect and unfair world we love him because he first loved us 1 john 419 his love for us is immeasurable he is our truest friend he sweat as it were great drops of blood for you and also for me luke 2244 he forgave the seemingly unforgivable he loved the unlovable he did what no mortal could do he provided an atonement to overcome the transgressions pains and sicknesses of all mankind because of the atonement of jesus christ we can live with the promise that no matter what our struggles may be we can always have hope in him who is mighty to save 2 nephi 3119 because of his atonement we can have joy peace happiness and eternal life president boyd k packer stated save for the exception of the very few who defect to perdition there is no habit no addiction no rebellion no transgression no apostasy no crime exempted from the promise of complete forgiveness that is the promise of the atonement of christ2 one of the most incredible events in human history is the saviors ministering visit to the ancient inhabitants of america visualize in your mind what it would be like to have been there as i have pondered his loving and tender care of that band of saints gathered at the temple i have reflected on individual children whom i love more than life itself i have tried to conceive of how i would feel to behold our little ones to personally witness the savior inviting each child to come unto him to witness the saviors outstretched arms to stand by as each child one by one gently feels the prints in his hands and in his feet and then to see each of them stand and bear record that he lives see 3 nephi 111417 see also 1721 1825 to have our children turn and say mom dad its him imagesavior with children i dont know if anything in this world could bring more happiness and joy than to know that our children know the savior to know that they know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins that is why as members of the church we preach of christ and we testify of christ 2 nephi 2526 that is why we pray with our children every day that is why we read the scriptures with them every day that is why we teach them to serve others so that they can hold claim upon the blessings of finding themselves as they lose themselves in the service of others see mark 835 mosiah 217 as we devote ourselves to these simple patterns of discipleship we empower our children with the love of the savior and with divine direction and protection as they face the fierce winds of the adversary the gospel truly is about the one it is about one lost sheep see luke 1537 it is about one samaritan woman at a well see john 4530 it is about one prodigal son see luke 151132 and it is about one little boy who might claim he is not listening it is about each one of usas imperfect as we may bebecoming one with the savior as he is one with his father see john 1721 i testify that we have a loving heavenly father who knows us by name i testify that jesus christ is the living son of the living god he is the only begotten and our advocate with the father i further testify that salvation comes in and through his nameand in no other way it is my prayer that we will devote our hearts and our hands to helping all of heavenly fathers children to know him and to feel his love as we do he promises us eternal joy and happiness in this world and in the world to come in the name of jesus christ amen notes message of the first presidency in conference report oct 1942 1213 read by president j reuben clark jr boyd k packer the brilliant morning of forgiveness ensign nov 1995 20
