hands by elder thomas s monson of the council of the twelve imageelder thomas s monson when jesus of nazareth taught and ministered among men he spoke not as did the scribes and scholars of the day but rather in language understood by all jesus taught through parables his teachings moved men and motivated them to a newness of life the shepherd on the hillside the sower in the field the fisherman at his net all became subjects whereby the master taught eternal truths the divinely created human body with its truly marvelous powers and intricate parts acquired new meaning when the lord spoke of eyes that were not blinded but did really see ears that were not stopped but did truly hear and hearts that were not hardened but did know and feel in his teachings he referred to the foot the nose the face the side the back significant are those occasions when he spoke of yet another parteven the human hand considered by artists and sculptors the most difficult member of the human body to capture on canvas or form in clay the hand is a wonder to behold neither color size shape nor age distorts this miracle of creation first let us consider the hand of a child who among us has not praised god and marveled at his powers when an infant is held in ones arms that tiny hand so small yet so perfect instantly becomes the topic of conversation no one can resist placing his little finger in the clutching hand of an infant a smile comes to the lips a certain glow to the eyes and one appreciates the tender feelings which prompted the poet to pen the lines a sweet new blossom of humanity fresh fallen from gods own home to flower on earth gerald massey as the child grows the tightly clutched hand opens in an expression of perfect trust take me by the hand mother then i wont be afraid bespeaks this confidence the delightful song the little children sing so beautifully at once becomes a plea for patience an invitation to teacheven an opportunity to serve i have two little hands folded snugly and tight they are tiny and weak yet they know what is right during all the long hours till daylight is through there is plenty indeed for my two hands to do kind father i thank thee for two little hands and ask thee to bless them till each understands that children can only be happy all day when two little hands have learned how to obey the children sing no 97 the sentiments such love and faith arouse should ever draw forth from each parent a pledge of fidelityeven a determination to do that which is right should added emphasis be required we need but refer to that account where the disciples came unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea matt 1813 56 significant is the hand of a

glistens on her finger a ring denoting a sacred pledge her step becomes quicker her countenance brighter and all is well with the world courtship has come marriage follows and once again two hands are clasped this time in a holy temple cares of the world are for a brief moment forgotten thoughts turn to eternal values the clasped hands speak of promised hearts heaven is here time passes the hand of

years ever shall i remember the hand of one motherthe mother of a missionary some years ago at a worldwide seminar for mission presidents the parents of missionaries were invited to meet and visit briefly with each mission president forgotten are the names of each who extended a greeting and exchanged a friendly handshake remembered are the feelings which welled up within me as i took in my hand the calloused hand of one mother from star valley wyoming please excuse the roughness of my hand she apologized since my husband has been ill the work of the farm has been mine to do that our boy

hands of a mother not to be overlooked is the hand of a father whether he be a skilled surgeon a master craftsman or a talented teacher his hands support his family there is a definite dignity in

beyond words both brother and sister paul they wondered they worried they prayed for assurance and heavenly confirmation such did not come suddenly the vote of the people demonstrated their supporting approval then came the time for ordination in a basement room situated two floors beneath the meeting hall in which the conference was held dewitt paul nervously sat on a chair and with a silent prayer in his heart awaited his ordination president harold b lee then placed his hands upon the head of the newly called patriarch and began to speak peace replaced turmoil faith overcame doubt seated next to sister paul was a lifelong friend to whom sister paul had confided her concern during the pronouncement of the blessing and ordination she opened her eyes as she did so she saw a ray of light shining upon president lee as he placed his hands upon the head of brother paul at the conclusion of the blessing she hastened to tell brother lee of this confirmation of a call she recounted how she saw the sunshine form the ray of light and how it brought a bright glow to the hands of president lee indeed this is to you a confirmation of a sacred call said president lee for as you look about this basement room there is no window through which the sun might beam its rays precious are the hands of a prophet finally may we speak of yet another handeven the hand of the lord this was the
