successful parenthooda noteworthy accomplishment by elder elray l christiansen assistant to the council of the twelve imageelder elray l christiansen first of all my brothers and sisters let me assure you that as far as elray l christiansen is concerned god lives and he is a compassionate understanding father and his son jesus christ came to earth as the bible tells us and offered himself and actually gave his life that we might be redeemed from the grave and might have eternal life salvation which to us means exaltation in the celestial world i testify that joseph smith was selected by god and jesus christ to restore the gospel in this day and that joseph fielding smith whom we appreciate is one of a succession of modernday prophets seers and revelators now this is a world in difficulty and trouble but we shouldnt merely bemoan the fact we should as far as our powers can help us be anxiously engaged in rectifying it just before we sang i wrote this down if you and i are to help restore this sick world to its spiritual health we must begin at the proper placethat is with ourselves and with our families this we can do one of the most rewarding of all human undertakings is that of making a success of marriage and of rearing children in a manner acceptable to the lord it calls for the best in all of us while many both in and out of the church are eminently successful in rearing their families it is clearly evident that there are fathers and mothers who are divesting themselves of their sacred obligation to counsel their children and to give them the parental warmth and interest that they deserve some parents are quite willing to let others tend and teach and train their most precious possessionstheir children did you hear the timely admonition of our president and prophet this morning pleading for fathers to take their rightful places at the head of their households in righteousness an authenticated study shows that two million children in america live in homes where serious trouble exists between parents six and a half million children live with only one parent and another million have been farmed out to relatives or friends or institutions some worthy institutions have been developed to help improve the home and family life but helpful as these agencies may be i am convinced and i believe you will agree that there is not and never will be a better institution for improving the home than the home itself parents cannot without regrettable consequences shirk the responsibility of teaching and showing their children through their example the attributes of character that lead them unhesitatingly to appreciate and accept the good the decent the beautiful and help them to develop the desire and the courage to turn from that which is coarse or crude or wrong to help us develop desirable qualities in our children we are provided with divinely given programs such as the family home evenings and for the life of me i cannot understand why every single family in the church doesnt grasp the opportunities provided through family home eveningit costs nothing it isnt necessary to leave home and yet it is one of the most effective ways of cementing the unity of our families that has ever come to us and when consistently used it has proven to be a marvelous means of making family life secure and meaningful parenthood is a sacred trust it is an approach to the divinea godgiven privilege that with its neverending responsibilities brings rich and lasting rewards president joseph f smith made this significant statement the man and the woman who are the agents in the providence of god to bring living souls into the world are made before god and the heavens as responsible for these acts as is god himself responsible for the works of his own hands gospel doctrine p 342 a home approved of god is not merely a place where children are born but where their coming is received with joy and gladness by parents who strive with all their abilities to help their children develop such attributes as faith in god along with a desire to be obedient to his commandments respect for and obedience to the laws of the land a determination to be truthful and honest regardless of the circumstances unselfishness by teaching mostly by example along with courtesy respect refinement and good manners for surely they are part of our religion after all the sermon for a teenage child that proves to be most ample is still the one that parents teach by setting an example hal chadwick success in family life calls for parents who take time to enjoy their children who read with them who play with them who let them participate in planning special occasions seeking to make wholesome family traditions a proud part of family life the case of a young man the father of four children whom we called upon to speak in a stake conference in eastern utah emphasizes the desirability of family traditions special occasions and warm family relationships on each anniversary of their marriage this couple planned something special to do now they had looked forward as a family to observing their tenth anniversary the father arranged his vacation to cover that period of time but suddenly it became necessary for his wife to enter the hospital for surgery he and the children felt sorry for her because she was in the hospital at the same time she was sad thinking that her husband and the children would be disappointed but when she read the little note that came with a bouquet of flowers she felt better for it read sweetheart ten years with you have seemed like ten days but ten days without you have seemed like ten years signed bill another essential in successful parenthood is for fathers and mothers to avoid disputations such situations may seem harmless to the parents but in the eyes of their children the two most important people in the world are in conflict and from their limited perspective the whole world is in trouble situations thus created are an indication of immaturity and weakness on the part of those involved someone has said that one of the most important things a father can do for his children is to love and respect their mother i plead with parents to rise above pettiness and to spare their children the inglorious and painful insecurity of having to endure petty disputations and offensive situations it is important also to keep the avenues of communication open it is wonderful when a father or a mother will sit down with a son or a daughter and discuss a personal problem and they have their problems which if we are wise we will not minimize there are pressures and enticements and even unjust accusations against which our sons and daughters need to be fortified it is even more wonderful when because of the love and closeness that exists children feel no hesitancy in taking their problems to their parents in such hearttoheart talks parents will help to set objectives for their children such as a desire and determination to live clean virtuous lives a desire to associate with those who have their same high standards and ideals a determination for boys to live so they may receive the priesthood in worthiness to prepare for and be worthy of being called on missions perhaps establishing a savings account early in life for this purpose a determination to gain an education to learn a trade or a profession or to master a skill and teach them the joy of working to prepare to be worthy and desirous of marriage in the temple thus doing things the lords way to prepare to become in their own right successful homemakers we talk a good deal these days about security my brothers and sisters there is no security that we can give our children that is more essential than the security they gain in homes where families operate as families should according to the gospel of jesus christ where families kneel and offer prayers of thanksgiving and gratitude at the beginning and at the close of each day where keeping the commandments of god is a part of daily life in this way they become fortified and enabled to meet the future without frustration and without fear historians almost without exception point out that one of the greatest contributing factors in the downfall of nations is the disintegration of the home and family life a complete rebirth of satisfactory family life is needed it is needed even in the socalled better homes it must begin with proper love and respect between the husband and the wife and then by their example transferred to their children no nation can long endure unless the great majority of its families and its homes are made secure through faith in godan active living faith in the scouters minute ymmia 1969 i found these lines so long as there are homes to which men turn at close of day so long as there are homes where children are where women stay if love and loyalty and faith be found across those sills a stricken nation can recover from its gravest ills so long as there are homes where fires burn and there is bread i think that means homemade bread so long as there are homes where lamps are lit and prayers are said although a people falter through the darkand nations grope with god himself back of these little homes we have sure hope to this i testify in the name of jesus christ the lord amen
