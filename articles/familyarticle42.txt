whoso receiveth them receiveth me by elder neil l andersen of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder neil l andersen children today find themselves in many different and complex family configurations we need to reach out to those who feel alone left behind or outside the fence god loves children he loves all children the savior said suffer the little children to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven1 children today find themselves in many different and complex family configurations for example today twice as many children in the united states are living with only one parent than were 50 years ago2 and there are many families that are less unified in their love of god and willingness to keep his commandments in this increasing spiritual commotion the restored gospel will continue to carry the standard the ideal the pattern of the lord children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness to provide for their physical and spiritual needs and to teach them to love and serve one another and observe the commandments of god3 we recognize the many good parents across the world of all faiths who lovingly care for their children and we gratefully acknowledge the families in the church of jesus christ of latterday saints who are wrapped in the care of a father and mother converted to the savior who are sealed by the authority of the priesthood and who are learning in their family to love and trust their heavenly father and his son jesus christ plea for the youth but my plea today is for the hundreds of thousands of children youth and young adults who do not come from these for lack of a better term pictureperfect families i speak not only of the youth who have experienced the death divorce or diminishing faith of their parents but also of the tens of thousands of young men and young women from all around the world who embrace the gospel without a mother or father to come into the church with them4 these young latterday saints enter the church with great faith they hope to create the family ideal in their own lives at a future day5 in time they become an important part of our missionary force our righteous young adults and those who kneel at an altar to begin their own families sensitivity we will continue to teach the lords pattern for families but now with millions of members and the diversity we have in the children of the church we need to be even more thoughtful and sensitive our church culture and vernacular are at times quite unique the primary children are not going to stop singing families can be together forever6 but when they sing im so glad when daddy comes home7 or with father and mother leading the way8 not all children will be singing about their own family our friend bette shared an experience she had at church when she was 10 years old she said our teacher was sharing a lesson about temple marriage she specifically asked me bette your parents werent married in the temple were they my teacher and the rest of the class knew the answer the teachers lesson followed and bette imagined the worst bette said i had many tearful nights when i had heart problems two years later and thought i was going to die i panicked thinking i would be alone forever my friend leif attended church by himself once while in primary he was asked to give a short talk he had no mom or dad at church to stand beside him and help him if he forgot what to say leif was terrified rather than embarrass himself he just stayed away from church for several months jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me9 believing hearts and spiritual gifts these children and youth are blessed with believing hearts and spiritual gifts leif told me i knew deep in the recesses of my mind that god was my father and that he knew me and loved me our friend veronique said as i learned the principles of the gospel and studied the book of mormon it was as though i was remembering things that i had already known but had forgotten our friend zuleika comes from alegrete brazil although her family was not religious at age 12 zuleika began to read the bible and visit local churches searching to know more about god with her parents reluctant permission she studied with the missionaries gained a testimony and was baptized zuleika told me during the discussions i was shown a picture of the salt lake temple and told about the sealing ordinances from that moment i had the desire of one day entering into the house of the lord and having an eternal family while a childs earthly situation may not be ideal a childs spiritual dna is perfect because ones true identity is as a son or daughter of god president thomas s monson has said help gods children understand what is genuine and important in this life help them develop the strength to choose paths that will keep them safely on the way to eternal life10 lets open our arms and our hearts a little wider these youth need our time and our testimonies brandon who joined the church in colorado in high school spoke to me of those who reached out to him both before and after his baptism he said i was in the homes of families that lived the gospel it showed me a standard that i felt i could have in my own family veronique born in the netherlands attended school with our daughter kristen when we lived in germany veronique noted students who were church members had a light about them i came to realize that that light came from their faith in jesus christ and living his teachings my friend max was baptized when he was eight years old his father was not a member of any church and max could go to church or not go as a teenager after not attending for several months max had the feeling that he needed to go back to church and determined one sunday morning that he would return but his resolve weakened as he approached the front door of the church his stomach tightened there standing at the door was the new bishop max didnt know him and he felt sure the bishop didnt know max as max approached the bishops face lit up and he put his hand out and said max its so good to see you as he spoke those words max said a warm feeling came over me and i knew i had done the right thing11 knowing someones name can make a difference and jesus commanded that their little children should be brought to him and he took them one by one and blessed them and prayed unto the father for them and when he had done this he wept12 youth not yet baptized at the request of parents many youth who love the gospel wait years to be baptized emilys parents divorced while she was a child and she did not receive permission to be baptized until she was 15 our friend emily speaks glowingly of a young women leader who always reached out and helped strengthen her testimony13 colten and preston are teenagers who live in utah their parents are divorced and they have not received permission to be baptized even though they cant pass the sacrament they bring the bread each week and even though they cant enter the temple to do baptisms with the youth when their ward goes to the temple the two brothers find family names next door at the family history center the greatest influence on helping our youth feel included is other righteous youth elder joseph ssengooba i close with the example of a new friend someone we met a few weeks ago while visiting the zambia lusaka mission imagejoseph ssengooba as a young boy elder joseph ssengooba is from uganda his father died when he was seven at age nine with his mother and relatives unable to care for him he was on his own at age 12 he met the missionaries and was baptized joseph told me of his first day at church after sacrament meeting i thought it was time to go home but the missionaries introduced me to joshua walusimbi joshua told me that he was going to be my friend and he handed me a childrens songbook so i wouldnt have to go into primary emptyhanded in primary joshua put an extra chair right next to his the primary president invited me to the front and asked the whole primary to sing for me i am a child of god i felt very special the branch president took joseph to the pierre mungoza family and that became his home for the next four years imageelders joshua walusimbi and joseph ssengooba eight years later when elder joseph ssengooba began his mission to his great surprise his trainer was elder joshua walusimbi the boy who had made him feel so welcome on his first day in primary and his mission president he is president leif erickson the little boy who stayed away from primary because he was terrified about giving a talk god loves his children imageelder joseph ssengooba and president leif erickson the children came running when my wife kathy and i were in africa a few weeks ago we visited mbujimayi democratic republic of the congo because the chapel was not large enough for the 2000 members we met out of doors under large plastic coverings supported by bamboo poles as the meeting began we could see dozens of children watching us clinging to the bars on the outside of the wroughtiron fence that surrounded the property kathy quietly whispered neil do you think that you might want to invite the children to come in i approached district president kalonji at the podium and asked him if he would welcome the children outside the fence to come join us inside imageelder andersen in democratic republic of the congo imagechildren outside fence imagechildren invited to come inside to my surprise with president kalonjis invitation the children not only came but came runningmore than 50 perhaps 100some with tattered clothes and bare feet but all with beautiful smiles and excited faces i was deeply moved by this experience and saw it as symbolic of our need to reach out to the youth who feel alone left behind or outside the fence let us think about them welcome them embrace them and do everything we can to strengthen their love for the savior jesus said whoso shall receive one such child in my name receiveth me14 in the name of jesus christ amen notes matthew 1914 see family structure child trends databank dec 2015 appendix 1 page 9

single parents who courageously take the primary responsibility of spiritually strengthening their children our friend shelley from canada said of her mother missionaries knocked on my parents door five years before i was born my parents took a few lessons and then my father didnt have any more interest my mother continued to take the lessons and desired baptism for five years my mother went to church as a nonmember and then three months after i was born she was able to be baptized my mother has never been very vocal or in great leadership positions she has a very simple sweet steady testimony and she lives every day true to what she believes that quiet simple example has always kept me close to the lord and to the church our friend randall told me i was taught and i knew that i was a son of heavenly parents and knowing my real identity and nature gave me hope that i didnt need to follow the same course as my parents whom i adored but didnt want to copy i trusted what i had been taught by primary sunday school and young men and other teachers i saw examples in the ward and my extended family of faithful happy families and i trusted heavenly father knowing that if i remained faithful he would help me have such a family families can be together forever childrens songbook 188 daddys homecoming childrens songbook 210 love is spoken here childrens songbook 19091
