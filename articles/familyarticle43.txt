in praise of those who save by president dieter f uchtdorf second counselor in the first presidency imagepresident dieter f uchtdorf as we emulate the saviors love he will surely bless and prosper our righteous efforts to save our marriages and strengthen our families many years ago i was at the frankfurt germany temple when i noticed an elderly couple holding hands the caring tenderness and affection they showed to each other warmed my heart im not completely sure why this scene affected me so profoundly perhaps it was the sweetness of the love these two people shared for one anothera compelling symbol of perseverance and commitment it was clear that this couple had been together for a long time and their affection for one another was still alive and strong a society of disposables i think another reason this tender scene has stayed with me for so long is the contrast to some of todays attitudes in so many societies around the world everything seems to be disposable as soon as something starts to break down or wear outor even when we simply grow tired of itwe throw it out and replace it with an upgrade something newer or shinier we do this with cell phones clothes carsand tragically even with relationships while there may be value in decluttering our lives of material things we no longer need when it comes to things of eternal importanceour marriages our families and our valuesa mindset of replacing the original in favor of the modern can bring profound remorse i am grateful that i belong to a church that values marriage and family members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints are known throughout the world for having some of the finest marriages and families you can find i believe this is in part due to the precious truth restored by joseph smith that marriages and families are meant to be eternal families are not just meant to make things run more smoothly here on earth and to be cast off when we get to heaven rather they are the order of heaven they are an echo of a celestial pattern and an emulation of gods eternal family but strong marriage and family relationships do not happen just because we are members of the church they require constant intentional work the doctrine of eternal families must inspire us to dedicate our best efforts to saving and enriching our marriages and families i admire and applaud those who have preserved and nourished these critical eternal relationships today i wish to speak in praise of those who save saving our marriages over the years i have performed the sealing ordinance for many hopeful and loving couples i have never met anyone who as they looked at each other across the altar thought they would end up divorced or heartbroken unfortunately some do somehow as the days multiply and the color of romantic love changes there are some who slowly stop thinking of each others happiness and start noticing the little faults in such an environment some are enticed by the tragic conclusion that their spouse isnt smart enough fun enough or young enough and somehow they get the idea that this gives them justification to start looking elsewhere brethren if this comes close to describing you at all i warn you that you are on a road that leads to broken marriages broken homes and broken hearts i plead with you to stop now turn around and come back to the safe path of integrity and loyalty to covenants and of course the same principles apply for our dear sisters now just one word to those of our single brethren who follow the deception that they first have to find the perfect woman before they can enter into serious courting or marriage my beloved brethren may i remind you if there were a perfect woman do you really think she would be that interested in you in gods plan of happiness we are not so much looking for someone perfect but for a person with whom throughout a lifetime we can join efforts to create a loving lasting and more perfect relationship that is the goal brethren those who save their marriages understand that this pursuit takes time patience and above all the blessings of the atonement of jesus christ it requires you to be kind envy not seek not your own not be easily provoked think no evil and rejoice in the truth in other words it requires charity the pure love of christ1 all this wont just happen in an instant great marriages are built brick by brick day after day over a lifetime and that is good news because no matter how flat your relationship may be at the present if you keep adding pebbles of kindness compassion listening sacrifice understanding and selflessness eventually a mighty pyramid will begin to grow if it appears to take forever remember happy marriages are meant to last forever so be not weary in welldoing for ye are laying the foundation of a great marriage and out of small things proceedeth that which is great2 it may be a gradual work but it doesnt have to be a cheerless one in fact at the risk of stating the obvious divorce rarely happens when the husband and wife are happy so be happy and brethren astonish your wife by doing things that make her happy those who save their marriages choose happiness while its true that some types of chronic depression require specialized treatment i am fond of this bit of wisdom by abraham lincoln most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be it fits nicely with its scriptural companion seek and ye shall find3 if we look for imperfections in our spouse or irritations in our marriage we will certainly find them because everyone has some on the other hand if we look for the good we will surely find it because everyone has many good qualities too those who save marriages pull out the weeds and water the flowers they celebrate the small acts of grace that spark tender feelings of charity those who save marriages save future generations brethren remember why you fell in love work each day to make your marriage stronger and happier my dear friends let us do our very best to be numbered among those hallowed and happy souls who save their marriages saving our families today i also wish to speak in praise of those who save their relationships with their families every family needs saving as wonderful as it is that this church is known for its strong families we may often feel this must apply to every latterday saint family except ours but the reality is that there are no perfect families every family has moments of awkwardness like when your parents ask you to take a selfie of them or when your greataunt insists that you are still single because you are just too picky or when your opinionated brotherinlaw thinks his political view is the gospel view or when your dad arranges a family portrait with everyone dressed like characters in his favorite movie and you get the chewbacca costume families are like that we may share the same gene pool but we are not the same we have unique spirits we are influenced in different ways by our experiences and each of us ends up different as a result rather than attempting to force everyone into a mold of our own making we can choose to celebrate these differences and appreciate them for adding richness and constant surprises to our lives sometimes however members of our families make choices or do things that are thoughtless hurtful or immoral what should we do in these cases there is not one solution that covers every situation those who save their families are successful because they counsel with their spouse and family seek the will of the lord and listen for the promptings of the holy ghost they know that what is right for one family may not be right for another however there is one thing that is right in every case in the book of mormon we learn of a people who had discovered the secret to happiness for generations there was no contention and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of god how did they do it because of the love of god which did dwell in the hearts of the people4 whatever problems your family is facing whatever you must do to solve them the beginning and the end of the solution is charity the pure love of christ without this love even seemingly perfect families struggle with it even families with great challenges succeed charity never faileth5 it is true for saving marriages it is true for saving families set aside pride the great enemy of charity is pride pride is one of the biggest reasons marriages and families struggle pride is shorttempered unkind and envious pride exaggerates its own strength and ignores the virtues of others pride is selfish and easily provoked pride assumes evil intent where there is none and hides its own weaknesses behind clever excuses pride is cynical pessimistic angry and impatient indeed if charity is the pure love of christ then pride is the defining characteristic of satan pride may be a common human failing but it is not part of our spiritual heritage and it has no place among holders of the priesthood of god life is short brethren regrets can last a long timesome will have repercussions that echo through eternity the way you treat your wife or children or parents or siblings may influence generations to come what legacy do you want to leave your posterity one of harshness vengeance anger fear or isolation or one of love humility forgiveness compassion spiritual growth and unity we all need to remember judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy6 for the sake of your family relationships for the sake of your soul please be merciful for mercy triumphs over judgment7 set aside pride sincerely apologizing to your children your wife your family or your friends is not a sign of weakness but of strength is being right more important than fostering an environment of nurturing healing and love build bridges dont destroy them even when you are not at faultperhaps especially when you are not at faultlet love conquer pride if you do this whatever adversity you are facing will pass and because of the love of god in your hearts contention will fade these principles of saving relationships apply to all of us regardless of whether we are married divorced widowed or single we all can be saviors of strong families the greatest love brethren in our efforts to save our marriages and families as in all things let us follow the example of the one who saves us the savior won our souls with love8 jesus christ is our master his work is our work it is a saving work and it begins in our homes love in the fabric of the plan of salvation is selfless and seeks the wellbeing of others that is the love our heavenly father has for us as we emulate the saviors love he will surely bless and prosper our righteous efforts to save our marriages and strengthen our families may the lord bless you in your untiring and righteous efforts to be numbered among those who save this
