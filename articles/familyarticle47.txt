plain and precious truths by elder gary e stevenson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder gary e stevenson heavenly fathers generous compensation for living in perilous times is that we also live in the fulness of times dear brothers and sisters it has been many decades since a general conference has been convened that president boyd k packer and elders l tom perry and richard g scott were not seated immediately behind the podium and speaking at one of these sessions our memories of them are poignant and i add my tribute to honor them each so uniquely different yet so harmonized in their witness and testimony of jesus christ and his atonement furthermore i like you find strength in and sustain president thomas s monson as prophet seer and revelator and i marvel at his faithful and dutiful apostolic service spanning over 50 remarkable years and so it was on tuesday morning of this week just after 900 am as the bishopric was beginning a meeting with the asia area presidency who are here for conference that i was called to meet with president monson along with his counselors moments later as i walked into the boardroom adjacent to his office i must have looked nervous sitting across the table as he kindly spoke to calm my nerves he commented noting my age that i seemed quite young and even looked younger than my age then within a few moments president monson described that acting on the will of the lord he was extending a call to the quorum of the twelve to me he asked me if i would accept this call to which following what i am sure was a very undignified audible gasp in complete shock i responded affirmatively and then before i could even verbalize a tsunami of indescribable emotion most of which were feelings of inadequacy president monson kindly reached out to me describing how he was called many years ago as an apostle by president david o mckay at which time he too felt inadequate he calmly instructed me bishop stevenson the lord will qualify those whom he calls these soothing words of a prophet have been a source of peace a calm in a storm of painful selfexamination and tender feelings in the ensuing agonizing hours which have passed day and night since then i rehearsed what i have just described to you to my sweet companion lesa later that day seated in a quiet corner on temple square with a serene view of the temple and the historic tabernacle lying before us as we tried to comprehend and process the events of the day we found our anchor to be our faith in jesus christ and our knowledge of the great plan of happiness this leads to an expression of my deepest love for lesa she is the sunshine in and of my life and a remarkable daughter of god hers is a life punctuated by selfless service and unconditional love of all i will strive to remain worthy of the blessing of our eternal union i express my deepest love to our four sons and their families three of whom are here with their beautiful wives the mothers of our six grandchildren the fourth a missionary has special permission to stay up past missionary curfew and is viewing these proceedings live with his mission president and the mission presidents wife from their mission home in taiwan i love each of them and love how they love the savior and the gospel i express my love to each member of my family to my dear mother and to my father who passed away last year who instilled in me a testimony which seemed to dwell in me from my earliest memories i further extend this gratitude to my brother sisters and their faithful spouses as well as lesas family many of whom are actually here today i cast this net of gratitude to numerous extended family friends missionaries leaders and teachers along the way i have been blessed with a close association with the members of the first presidency the twelve the seventy and the general auxiliary presidencies i express my love and esteem to each of you sisters and brothers and will strive to be worthy of our continued association the presiding bishopric enjoys an almost heavenly unity i will miss my association each day with bishop gérald caussé bishop dean m davies and the staff i stand before you as evidence of the words of the lord recorded in the first section of the doctrine and covenants that the fulness of the gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the earth and before kings and rulers1 these words are preceded by the lords declaration which demonstrates the love of a father for his children wherefore i the lord knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth called upon my servant joseph smith jun and spake unto him from heaven and gave him commandments2 our loving heavenly father and his son jehovah with a knowledge of the end from the beginning3 opened the heavens and a new dispensation to offset the calamities that they knew would come the apostle paul described the forthcoming calamities as perilous times4 for me this suggests that heavenly fathers generous compensation for living in perilous times is that we also live in the fulness of times as i agonized over my inadequacies this week i received a distinct impression which both chastened and comforted me to focus not on what i cant do but rather on what i can do i can testify of the plain and precious truths of the gospel these are the words which i have shared hundreds of times with both those who belong to the church and many who are not members god is our loving heavenly father we are his children he weeps with us when we suffer and rejoices when we do what is right he wants to communicate with us and we can communicate with him through sincere prayer heavenly father has provided us his children with a way to return to live in his presence central to our heavenly fathers plan is jesus christs atonement5 heavenly father sent his son to the earth to atone for the sins of all mankind of these plain and precious truths i bear my testimony and i do so in the name of jesus christ amen notes doctrine and covenants 123 doctrine and covenants 117 see abraham 28 2 timothy 31 preach my gospel a guide to missionary service 2004 3132
