come to know his great love for each one of us my dear brothers and sisters throughout the world im very grateful to the first presidency for inviting me to share my humble testimony this sabbath day the words of a favorite latterday saint hymn describe my current feelings i stand all amazed at the love jesus offers me confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me i marvel that he would descend from his throne divine to rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine that he should extend his great love unto such as i sufficient to own to redeem and to justify oh it is wonderful wonderful to me1 a few days ago i had the great privilege to meet with the first presidency and receive this call from our dear prophet president thomas s monson i want to witness to all of you of the
