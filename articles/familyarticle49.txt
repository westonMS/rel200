here to serve a righteous cause by carol f mcconkie first counselor in the young women general presidency imagecarol f mcconkie may we choose to serve a righteous cause as valiant emissaries of our lord jesus christ i am grateful that we may gather together with faithful women such as lisathe sister in the videowho are pure in heart who love the lord and serve him even amid their own trials lisas story reminds me that we must love one another and see in one another the beauty of the soul the savior taught remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of god1 whether we are age 8 or 108 each of us is precious in his sight2 he loves us we are daughters of god we are sisters in zion we have a divine nature and we each have a glorious work to do over the summer i visited with a lovely young mother of daughters she shared with me her feeling that our young women need a cause something to help them feel valued she knew that we may discover our individual and eternal worth by acting in accordance with our divine purpose in mortality tonight this beautiful and remarkable choir sang words that teach our purpose through test and trial even through fear and in the midst of despair we have valiant hearts we are resolved to do our part we are here to serve a righteous cause3 sisters in this cause we are all valued we are all needed the righteous cause we serve is the cause of christ it is the work of salvation4 the lord taught this is my work and my gloryto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man5 we are the cause for which jesus christ suffered bled from every pore and in perfect love gave his life his cause is the good news the glad tidings that he came into the world even jesus to be crucified for the world and to bear the sins of the world and to sanctify the world and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness that through him all might be saved6 our savior has marked the path and led the way7 i testify that as we follow his example love god and serve one another with kindness and compassion we may stand in purity blameless before god at the last day8 we choose to serve the lord in his righteous cause that we may become one with the father and with the son9 the prophet mormon boldly declared for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness and rest our souls in the kingdom of god10 the early church leaders and pioneers of the past pressed forward with heroic courage and determined faithfulness to establish the restored gospel and build temples where ordinances of exaltation could be performed the pioneers of the present meaning you and me also press forward in faith to labor in the lords vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men11 and as president gordon b hinckley taught how magnificent will be the future as the almighty rolls on his glorious work through the selfless service of those whose hearts are filled with love for the redeemer of the world12 we join with faithful sisters of the past of the present and of the rising generation when we join together in the work of salvation before we were born we accepted our heavenly fathers plan by which we could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize our divine destiny as heirs of eternal life13 of this premortal covenant elder john a widtsoe explained we agreed right then and there to be not only saviors for ourselves but saviors for the whole human family we went into a partnership with the lord the working out of the plan became then not merely the fathers work and the saviors work but also our work the least of us the humblest is in partnership with the almighty in achieving the purpose of the eternal plan of salvation14 here in mortality we have again covenanted to serve the savior in the work of salvation by participating in sacred priesthood ordinances we pledge that we will embark in the service of god with heart might mind and strength15 we receive the holy ghost and seek his promptings to guide our efforts righteousness emanates out to the world when we understand what god wants us to do and then we do it i know a primary child who said to a friend while standing at the bus stop hey you ought to come to church with me and learn about jesus i saw the girls in a young women class link arms together and make a commitment to minister to one another and then plan an appropriate way to help a young woman who was struggling with an addiction i have seen young mothers give everything of their time their talents and their energies to teach and exemplify the principles of the gospel so that their children like the sons of helaman may stand courageously and faithfully through trial temptation and adversity but perhaps most humbling to me was to hear a single adult sister declare with the fire of pure testimony that the most important work we can do is to prepare for marriage and family although this is not her experience she knows that family is the very heart of the work of salvation the divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave16 we honor the fathers plan and glorify god when we strengthen and ennoble those relationships in the new and everlasting covenant of marriage we choose to live pure and virtuous lives so that when the opportunity comes we are prepared to make that sacred covenant in the house of the lord and keep it forever we all experience times and seasons in our lives but whether we are at school at work in the community or especially in the home we are the lords agents and we are on his errand in the work of salvation there is no room for comparison criticism or condemnation it is not about age experience or public acclaim this sacred work is about developing a broken heart a contrite spirit and a willingness to use our divine gifts and unique talents to do the lords work in his way it is having the humility to fall on our knees and say o my father not as i will but as thou wilt17 in the strength of the lord we can do all things18 we continually seek his guidance in prayer in the scriptures and in the whisperings of the holy ghost one sister faced with an overwhelming assignment wrote sometimes i wonder if the sisters in the early history of the church didnt like us put their heads on their pillows at night and pray whatever tomorrow brings will thou help me through it then she wrote one of the blessings is that we have each other and we are in this together19 whatever our circumstances wherever we are along the path toward salvation we unite as one in our commitment to the savior we sustain one another in his service imageella hoskins completes personal progress recently you may have read about sister ella hoskins who at 100 years old was called to help the young women in her ward with personal progress20 about two years later at 102 sister hoskins earned her young womanhood recognition award the young women the ward and stake young women and relief society presidencies and family members gathered together to celebrate her accomplishment boundaries of age organization and marital status faded away in faithful service young women expressed gratitude for sister hoskins for her teaching and for her righteous example they want to be like her afterward i asked sister hoskins how did you do it she promptly responded i repent every day from a gentle lady so full of the spirit of the lord that she glowed with pure light i was reminded that to shine with the beauty of holiness to stand with the savior and to bless others we must be clean purity is possible through the grace of christ as we deny ungodliness and choose to love god with might mind and strength21 the apostle paul taught flee youthful lusts follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart22 none of us is perfect we have all made mistakes but we repent so that we may be better and retain the name of christ written always in our hearts23 when we serve in the name of the lord with purity of heart we reflect the saviors love and give others a glimpse of heaven may we choose to serve a righteous cause as valiant emissaries of our lord jesus christ let us stand together and with a song in our hearts move forward living the gospel loving the lord and building his kingdom24 i testify that in this glorious work we may know the pure love of god we may receive true joy and obtain all the glories of eternity in the sacred
