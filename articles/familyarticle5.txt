seeing gods family through the overview lens by sister tamara w runia first counselor in the young women general presidency i believe we can through the eye of faith zoom out and view ourselves and our families with hope and joy when our youngest daughter berkeley was little i started using reading glassesthe kind that zoom in and magnify everything one day as we sat together reading a book i looked at her with love but also sadness because suddenly she seemed more grown up i thought where has the time gone shes so big as i lifted my reading glasses to wipe away a tear i realized oh waitshes not bigger its just these glasses never mind sometimes all we can see is that upclose magnified view of those we love tonight i invite you to zoom out and look through a different lensan eternal lens that focuses on the big picture your bigger story during humankinds early push into space the unmanned rockets had no windows but by the apollo 8 mission to the moon the astronauts had one while floating in space they were struck by the power of seeing our earth and took this spectacular image capturing the whole worlds attention those astronauts experienced a sensation so powerful it has been given its own name the overview effect imageearth as seen from space nasa viewing from a new vantage point changes everything one space traveler said it reduces things to a size that you think everything is manageable we can do this peace on earthno problem it gives people that type of energy that type of power1 as humans we have an earthbound point of view but god sees the grand overview of the universe he sees all creation all of us and is filled with hope is it possible to begin to see as god sees even while living on the surface of this planetto feel this overview feeling i believe we can through the eye of faith zoom out and view ourselves and our families with hope and joy the scriptures agree moroni speaks about those whose faith was so exceedingly strong that they truly saw with an eye of faith and they were glad2 with an eye focused on the savior they felt joy and knew this truth because of christ it all works out everything you and you and you are worried aboutits all going to be ok and those who look with an eye of faith can feel that its going to be ok now i went through a rough patch my senior year in high school when i wasnt making great choices i remember seeing my mom crying and i wondered if id disappointed her at the time i worried that her tears meant shed lost hope for me and if she didnt feel hope for me maybe there wasnt a way back but my dad was more practiced at zooming out and taking the long view hed learned from experience that worry feels a lot like love but its not the same3 he used the eye of faith to see that everything would work out and his hopeful approach changed me when i graduated from high school and went to byu my dad sent letters reminding me of who i was he became my cheerleader and everybody needs a cheerleadersomeone who isnt telling you youre not running fast enough theyre lovingly reminding you that you can dad exemplified lehis dream like lehi he knew that you dont chase after your loved ones who feel lost you stay where you are and call them you go to the tree stay at the tree keep eating the fruit and with a smile on your face continue to beckon to those you love and show by example that eating the fruit is a happy thing4 this visual image has helped me during low moments when i find myself at the tree eating the fruit and crying because im worried and really how helpful is that instead lets choose hopehope in our creator and in one another fueling our ability to be better than we are right now shortly after elder neal a maxwell passed away a reporter asked his son what hed miss most he said dinners at his parents house because he always left feeling like his dad believed in him this was around the time our adult children were starting to come home for sunday dinners with their spouses during the week i found myself making lists in my mind of things i could remind them of on sunday like maybe try and help out more with the kids when youre home or dont forget to be a good listener when i read brother maxwells comment i threw away the lists and silenced that critical voice so when i saw my grown children for that brief time each week i focused on the many positive things they were already doing when our oldest son ryan passed away a few years later i remember being grateful our time together was happier and more positive before we interact with a loved one can we ask ourselves the question is what im about to do or say helpful or hurtful our words are one of our superpowers and family members are like human blackboards standing in front of us saying write what you think of me these messages whether intentional or unintentional should be hopeful and encouraging5 our job is not to teach someone whos going through a rough patch that they are bad or disappointing on rare occasions we may feel prompted to correct but most often lets tell our loved ones in spoken and unspoken ways the messages they long to hear our family feels whole and complete because you are in it you will be loved for the rest of your lifeno matter what sometimes what we need is empathy more than advice listening more than a lecture someone who hears and wonders how would i have to feel to say what they just said remember families are a godgiven laboratory where were figuring things out so missteps and miscalculations are not just possible but probable and wouldnt it be interesting if at the end of our lives we could see that those relationships even those challenging moments were the very things that helped us to become more like our savior each difficult interaction is an opportunity to learn how to love at a deeper levela godlike level6 lets zoom out to view family relationships as a powerful vehicle to teach us the lessons we came here to learn as we turn to the savior lets admit in a fallen world theres no way to be a perfect spouse parent son or daughter grandchild mentor or friendbut a million ways to be a good one7 lets stay at the tree partake of the love of god and share it by lifting the people around us we ascend together unfortunately the memory of eating the fruit is not enough we need to partake again and again in ways that reposition our lens and connect us to the heavenly overview by opening up the scriptures which are filled with light to chase away the darkness staying on our knees until our casual prayer turns mighty this is when hearts soften and we begin to see as god sees in these last days perhaps our greatest work will be with our loved onesgood people living in a wicked world our hope changes the way they see themselves and who they really are and through this lens of love theyll see who they will become but the adversary does not want us or our loved ones to return home together and because we live on a planet that is bound by time and a finite number of years8 he tries to perpetuate a very real sense of panic in us its hard to see when were zoomed in that our direction matters more than our speed remember if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go together9 thankfully the god we worship is not bound by time he sees who our loved ones really are and who we really are10 so hes patient with us hoping well be patient with each other i will admit there are times when earth our temporal home feels like an island of sorrowmoments when i have one eye of faith and the other eye is weeping11 do you know this feeling i had it tuesday can we instead choose the faithful posture of our prophet when he promises miracles in our families if we do our joy will increase even if turbulence increases hes promising that an overview effect can be experienced now regardless of our circumstances12 having this eye of faith now is a recapturing or an echo of the faith we had before we came to this planet it sees past the uncertainty of a moment allowing us to cheerfully do all things that lie in our power and then stand still13 is there something difficult in your life right now something youre worried cant be resolved without the eye of faith that might feel like god has lost oversight of things and is that true or maybe your greater fear is that youre going to go through this difficult time all by yourself but that would mean god has abandoned you and is that true it is my witness that the savior has the ability because of his atonement to turn any nightmare you are going through into a blessing he has given us a promise with an immutable covenant that as we strive to love and follow him all things wherewith we have been afflicted shall work together for our good14 all things and because we are children of the covenant we can ask for this hopeful feeling now while our families arent perfect we can perfect our love for others until it becomes a constant unchanging nomatterwhat kind of lovethe type of love that supports change and allows for growth and return its the saviors work to bring our loved ones back its his work and his timing it is our work to provide the hope and a heart they can come home to we have neither gods authority to condemn nor his power to redeem but we have been authorized to exercise his love15 president nelson has also taught that others need our love more than our judgment they need to experience the pure love of jesus christ reflected in our words and actions16 love is the thing that changes hearts it is the purest motive of all and others can feel it lets hold fast to these prophetic words offered 50 years ago no home is a failure unless it quits trying17 surely those who love the most and the longest win in earthly families were simply doing what god has done with uspointing the way and hoping our loved ones will go in that direction knowing the path they travel is theirs to choose and when they pass to the other side of the veil and draw close to that loving gravitational pull of their heavenly home18 i believe it will feel familiar because of how they were loved here lets use that overview lens and see the people we love and live with as shared companions on this beautiful planet you and i we can do this we can hold on and hope on we can stay at the tree and partake of the fruit with a smile on our face letting the light of christ in our eyes become something others can count on in their darkest hours as they see light manifest in our countenances they will be drawn to it we can then help refocus their attention to the original source of love and light the bright and morning star jesus christ19 i bear my testimony that thisall of thisis going to turn out so much better than we could ever imagine with an eye of faith on jesus christ may we see that everything will be all right in the end and feel that it will be all right now in the name of jesus christ amen notes
