behold thy mother by elder jeffrey r holland of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder jeffrey r holland no love in mortality comes closer to approximating the pure love of jesus christ than the selfless love a devoted mother has for her child may i join with all of you in welcoming elder ronald a rasband elder gary e stevenson and elder dale g renlund and their wives to the sweetest association they could possibly imagine prophesying of the saviors atonement isaiah wrote he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows1 a majestic latterday vision emphasized that jesus came into the world to bear the sins of the world2 both ancient and modern scripture testify that he redeemed them and bore them and carried them all the days of old3 a favorite hymn pleads with us to hear your great delivrers voice4 bear borne carry deliver these are powerful heartening messianic words they convey help and hope for safe movement from where we are to where we need to bebut cannot get without assistance these words also connote burden struggle and fatiguewords most appropriate in describing the mission of him who at unspeakable cost lifts us up when we have fallen carries us forward when strength is gone delivers us safely home when safety seems far beyond our reach my father sent me he said that i might be lifted up upon the cross that as i have been lifted up even so should men be lifted up to me5 but can you hear in this language another arena of human endeavor in which we use words like bear and borne carry and lift labor and deliver as jesus said to john while in the very act of atonement so he says to us all behold thy mother6 today i declare from this pulpit what has been said here before that no love in mortality comes closer to approximating the pure love of jesus christ than the selfless love a devoted mother has for her child when isaiah speaking messianically wanted to convey jehovahs love he invoked the image of a mothers devotion can a woman forget her sucking child he asks how absurd he implies though not as absurd as thinking christ will ever forget us7 this kind of resolute love suffereth long and is kind seeketh not her own but beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things8 most encouraging of all such fidelity never faileth9 for the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed jehovah said but my kindness shall not depart from thee10 so too say our mothers you see it is not only that they bear us but they continue bearing with us it is not only the prenatal carrying but the lifelong carrying that makes mothering such a staggering feat of course there are heartbreaking exceptions but most mothers know intuitively instinctively that this is a sacred trust of the highest order the weight of that realization especially on young maternal shoulders can be very daunting a wonderful young mother recently wrote to me how is it that a human being can love a child so deeply that you willingly give up a major portion of your freedom for it how can mortal love be so strong that you voluntarily subject yourself to responsibility vulnerability anxiety and heartache and just keep coming back for more of the same what kind of mortal love can make you feel once you have a child that your life is never ever your own again maternal love has to be divine there is no other explanation for it what mothers do is an essential element of christs work knowing that should be enough to tell us the impact of such love will range between unbearable and transcendent over and over again until with the safety and salvation of the very last child on earth we can then say with jesus father i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do11 with the elegance of that letter echoing in our minds let me share three experiences reflecting the majestic influence of mothers witnessed in my ministry in just the past few weeks my first account is a cautionary one reminding us that not every maternal effort has a storybook ending at least not immediately that reminder stems from my conversation with a beloved friend of more than 50 years who was dying away from this church he knew in his heart to be true no matter how much i tried to comfort him i could not seem to bring him peace finally he leveled with me jeff he said however painful it is going to be for me to stand before god i cannot bear the thought of standing before my mother the gospel and her children meant everything to her i know i have broken her heart and that is breaking mine now i am absolutely certain that upon his passing his mother received my friend with open loving arms that is what parents do but the cautionary portion of this story is that children can break their mothers heart here too we see another comparison with the divine i need not remind us that jesus died of a broken heart one weary and worn out from bearing the sins of the world so in any moment of temptation may we behold our mother as well as our savior and spare them both the sorrow of our sinning secondly i speak of a young man who entered the mission field worthily but by his own choice returned home early due to samesex attraction and some trauma he experienced in that regard he was still worthy but his faith was at crisis level his emotional burden grew ever heavier and his spiritual pain was more and more profound he was by turns hurt confused angry and desolate his mission president his stake president his bishop spent countless hours searching and weeping and blessing him as they held on to him but much of his wound was so personal that he kept at least parts of it beyond their reach the beloved father in this story poured his entire soul into helping this child but his very demanding employment circumstance meant that often the long dark nights of the soul were faced by just this boy and his mother day and night first for weeks then for months that turned into years they sought healing together through periods of bitterness mostly his but sometimes hers and unending fear mostly hers but sometimes his she boretheres that beautiful burdensome word againshe bore to her son her testimony of gods power of his church but especially of his love for this child in the same breath she testified of her own uncompromised undying love for him as well to bring together those two absolutely crucial essential pillars of her very existencethe gospel of jesus christ and her familyshe poured out her soul in prayer endlessly she fasted and wept she wept and fasted and then she listened and listened as this son repeatedly told her of how his heart was breaking thus she carried himagainonly this time it was not for nine months this time she thought that laboring through the battered landscape of his despair would take forever but with the grace of god her own tenacity and the help of scores of church leaders friends family members and professionals this importuning mother has seen her son come home to the promised land sadly we acknowledge that such a blessing does not or at least has not yet come to all parents who anguish over a wide variety of their childrens circumstances but here there was hope and i must say this sons sexual orientation did not somehow miraculously changeno one assumed it would but little by little his heart changed he started back to church he chose to partake of the sacrament willingly and worthily he again obtained a temple recommend and accepted a call to serve as an earlymorning seminary teacher where he was wonderfully successful and now after five years he has at his own request and with the churchs considerable assistance reentered the mission field to complete his service to the lord i have wept over the courage integrity and determination of this young man and his family to work things out and to help him keep his faith he knows he owes much to many but he knows he owes the most to two messianic figures in his life two who bore him and carried him labored with him and delivered himhis savior the lord jesus christ and his determined redemptive absolutely saintly mother lastly this from the rededication of the mexico city mexico temple just three weeks ago it was there with president henry b eyring that we saw our beloved friend lisa tuttle pieper stand in that moving dedicatory service but she stood with some difficulty because with one arm she was holding up her beloved but severely challenged daughter dora while with the other she was trying to manipulate doras dysfunctional right hand so this limited but eternally precious daughter of god could wave a white handkerchief and with groans intelligible only to herself and the angels of heaven cry out hosanna hosanna hosanna to god and the lamb12 to all of our mothers everywhere past present or future i say thank you thank you for giving birth for shaping souls for forming character and for demonstrating the pure love of christ to mother eve to sarah rebekah and rachel to mary of nazareth and to a mother in heaven i say thank you for your crucial role in fulfilling the purposes of eternity to all mothers in every circumstance including those who struggleand all willi say be peaceful believe in god and yourself you are doing better than you think you are in fact you are saviors on mount zion13 and like the master you follow your love never faileth14 i can pay no higher tribute to anyone in the name of jesus christ amen notes isaiah 534 doctrine and covenants 7641 doctrine and covenants 13353 see also isaiah 639 israel
