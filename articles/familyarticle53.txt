why marriage and family mattereverywhere in the world by elder l tom perry of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder l tom perry family is the center of life and is the key to eternal happiness last november i had the privilege of being invitedalong with president henry b eyring and bishop gérald causséto attend a colloquium on marriage and family at the vatican in rome italy in attendance were religious representatives from 14 different faiths and from six of the seven continents all of whom had been invited to express their beliefs on what is happening to the family in todays world imageelder perry president eyring and bishop caussé in rome pope francis opened the first session of the assembly with this statement we now live in a culture of the temporary in which more and more people are simply giving up on marriage as a public commitment this revolution in manners and morals has often flown the flag of freedom but in fact it has brought spiritual and material devastation to countless human beings especially the poorest and most vulnerable it is always they who suffer the most in this crisis1 in referring to those of the rising generation he said it is important that they do not give themselves over to the poisonous mentality of the temporary but rather be revolutionaries with the courage to seek true and lasting love going against the common pattern this must be done2 imageaudience in synod hall at the vatican this was followed by three days of presentation and discussion with religious leaders addressing the subject of marriage between a man and a woman as i listened to the widest imaginable variety of worldwide religious leaders i heard them agree completely with each other and express support for one anothers beliefs on the sanctity of the institution of marriage and of the importance of families as the basic unit of society i felt a powerful sense of commonality and unity with them there were many who saw and expressed this unity and they did so in a variety of ways one of my favorites was when a muslim scholar from iran quoted two paragraphs verbatim from our very own proclamation on the family during the colloquium i observed that when various faiths and denominations and religions are united on marriage and family they are also united on the values and loyalty and commitment which are naturally associated with family units it was remarkable for me to see how marriage and familycentered priorities cut across and superseded any political economic or religious differences when it comes to love of spouse and hopes worries and dreams for children we are all the same imagepresident eyring speaking in colloquium at the vatican it was marvelous to be in meetings with worldwide presenters as they universally addressed their feelings of the importance of marriage between a man and a woman each of their addresses was followed by testimonies from other religious leaders president henry b eyring gave a final testimony at the colloquium he bore powerful witness to the beauty of a committed marriage and to our belief in the promised blessing of eternal families president eyrings testimony was a fitting benediction to those three special days now you may be asking if the majority felt that similarity of family priority and beliefs if all of those faiths and religions essentially agreed on what marriage should be and if they all agreed on the value that should be placed on homes and family relationships then how are we any different how does the church of jesus christ of latterday saints distinguish and differentiate itself from the rest of the world here is the answer while it was wonderful to see and feel that we have so much in common with the rest of the world in regard to our families only we have the eternal perspective of the restored gospel what the restored gospel brings to the discussion on marriage and family is so large and so relevant that it cannot be overstated we make the subject eternal we take the commitment and the sanctity of marriage to a greater level because of our belief and understanding that families go back to before this earth was and that they can go forward into eternity this doctrine is taught so simply powerfully and beautifully by ruth gardners text for the primary song families can be together forever pause for just a moment and think about primary children all over the world singing these words in their native tongue at the top of their lungs with an enthusiasm that only love of family can evoke families can be together forever through heavenly fathers plan i always want to be with my own family and the lord has shown me how i can3 the entire theology of our restored gospel centers on families and on the new and everlasting covenant of marriage in the church of jesus christ of latterday saints we believe in a premortal life where we all lived as literal spirit children of god our heavenly father we believe that we were and still are members of his family we believe that marriage and family ties can continue beyond the gravethat marriages performed by those who have the proper authority in his temples will continue to be valid in the world to come our marriage ceremonies eliminate the words till death do us part and instead say for time and for all eternity we also believe that strong traditional families are not only the basic units of a stable society a stable economy and a stable culture of valuesbut that they are also the basic units of eternity and of the kingdom and government of god we believe that the organization and government of heaven will be built around families and extended families it is because of our belief that marriages and families are eternal that we as a church want to be a leader and a participant in worldwide movements to strengthen them we know that it is not only those who are actively religious who share common values and priorities of lasting marriages and strong family relationships a great number of secular people have concluded that a committed marriage and family lifestyle is the most sensible the most economical and the happiest way to live no one has ever come up with a more efficient way to raise the next generation than a household of married parents with children why should marriage and family mattereverywhere public opinion polls show that marriage is still the ideal and the hope among the majority of every age groupeven among the millennial generation where we hear so much about chosen singleness personal freedom and cohabitation instead of marriage the fact is that strong majorities worldwide still want to have children and to create strong families once we are married and once we have children the true commonality among all mankind becomes even more evident as family peopleno matter where we live or what our religious beliefs may bewe share many of the same struggles the same adjustments and the same hopes worries and dreams for our children as new york times columnist david brooks said people are not better off when they are given maximum personal freedom to do what they want theyre better off when they are enshrouded in commitments that transcend personal choicecommitments to family god craft and country4 one problem is that much of the media and entertainment that the world shares does not reflect the priorities and values of the majority for whatever reasons too much of our television movies music and internet present a classic case of a minority masquerading as a majority immorality and amorality ranging from graphic violence to recreational sex is portrayed as the norm and can cause those who have mainstream values to feel like we are out of date or from a bygone era in such a media and internetdominated world it has never been harder to raise responsible children and to keep marriages and families together despite what much of media and entertainment outlets may suggest however and despite the very real decline in the marriage and family orientation of some the solid majority of mankind still believes that marriage should be between one man and one woman they believe in fidelity within marriage and they believe in the marriage vows of in sickness and in health and till death do us part we need to remind ourselves once in a while as i was reminded in rome of the wonderfully reassuring and comforting fact that marriage and family are still the aspiration and ideal of most people and that we are not alone in those beliefs it has never been more of a challenge to find a practical balance between employment families and personal needs than it is in our day as a church we want to assist in all that we can to create and support strong marriages and families that is why the church actively participates in and provides leadership to various coalitions and ecumenical efforts to strengthen the family it is why we share our familyfocused values in the media and on social media it is why we share our genealogical and extended family records with all nations we want our voice to be heard against all of the counterfeit and alternative lifestyles that try to replace the family organization that god himself established we also want our voice to be heard in sustaining the joy and fulfillment that traditional families bring we must continue to project that voice throughout the world in declaring why marriage and family are so important why marriage and family really do matter and why they always will my brothers and sisters the restored gospel centers on marriage and family it is also on marriage and family where we can unite most with other faiths it is around marriage and family where we will find our greatest commonality with the rest of the world it is around marriage and family that the church of jesus christ of latterday saints has the greatest opportunity to be a light on the hill let me close by bearing witness and my nine decades on this earth fully qualify me to say this that the older i get the more i realize that family is the center of life and is the key to eternal happiness i give thanks for my wife for my children for my grandchildren and my greatgrandchildren and for all of the cousins and inlaws and extended family who make my own life so rich and yes even eternal of this eternal truth i bear my strongest and most sacred witness in
