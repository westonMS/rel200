the lord is my light by elder quentin l cook of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder quentin l cook our ability to stand firm and true and follow the savior despite the vicissitudes of life is greatly strengthened by righteous families and christcentered unity in our wards and branches in this easter season we reflect upon and rejoice in the redemption provided by our savior jesus christ1 the clamor that reverberates across the earth because of worldly wickedness creates feelings of vulnerability with modern communication the impact of iniquity inequality and injustice leaves many feeling that life is inherently unfair as significant as these trials can be they must not distract us from rejoicing in and celebrating christs supernal intercession in our behalf the savior literally gained the victory over death with mercy and compassion he took upon himself our iniquity and transgressions thus redeeming us and satisfying the demands of justice for all who would repent and believe on his name2 his magnificent atoning sacrifice is of transcendent significance beyond mortal comprehension this act of grace provides the peace that surpasses understanding3 how then do we deal with the harsh realities that surround us imagesunflowers my wife mary has always loved sunflowers she rejoices when they in quite improbable places appear on the roadside there is a dirt road that leads to the home where my grandparents lived when we started down that road mary would often exclaim do you think we will see those amazing sunflowers today we were surprised that sunflowers flourish in soil which has been impacted by farm and snow removal equipment and the accumulation of materials that would not be considered ideal soil for wildflowers to grow imagesunflowers by water one of the remarkable characteristics of young wild sunflowers in addition to growing in soil that is not hospitable is how the young flower bud follows the sun across the sky in doing so it receives lifesustaining energy before bursting forth in its glorious yellow color like the young sunflower when we follow the savior of the world the son of god we flourish and become glorious despite the many terrible circumstances that surround us he truly is our light and life in the parable of the wheat and the tares the savior declared to his disciples that those who offend and do iniquity shall be gathered out of his kingdom4 but speaking of the faithful he said then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father5 as individuals disciples of christ living in a hostile world that is literally in commotion we can thrive and bloom if we are rooted in our love of the savior and humbly follow his teachings our ability to stand firm and true and follow the savior despite the vicissitudes of life is greatly strengthened by righteous families and christcentered unity in our wards and branches6 the right time at home the role of the family in gods plan is to bring us happiness to help us learn correct principles in a loving atmosphere and to prepare us for eternal life7 the beautiful traditions of religious observance in the home need to be embedded in the hearts of our children my uncle vaughn roberts kimball was a good student an aspiring author and a byu football quarterback on december 8 1941 the day after the attack on pearl harbor he enlisted in the us navy while on a recruiting assignment in albany new york he submitted a short article to the readers digest the magazine paid him 200 and published his piece titled the right time at home in the may 1944 issue his contribution to the readers digest where he casts himself as the sailor reads in part the right time at home one evening in albany new york i asked a sailor what time it was he pulled out a huge watch and replied its 720 i knew it was later your watch has stopped hasnt it i asked no he said im still on mountain standard time im from southern utah when i joined the navy pa gave me this watch he said itd help me remember home when my watch says 5 am i know dad is rollin out to milk the cows and any night when it says 730 i know the whole familys around a wellspread table and dads thankin god for whats on it and askin him to watch over me he concluded i can find out what time it is where i am easy enough what i want to know is what time it is in utah8 soon after submitting the article vaughn was assigned to sea duty in the pacific theater on may 11 1945 while he was serving on the carrier uss bunker hill near okinawa the ship was bombed by two suicide planes9 almost 400 crewmen died including my uncle vaughn elder spencer w kimball extended his heartfelt sympathy to vaughns father noting vaughns worthiness and the lords assurance that those that die in me shall not taste of death for it shall be sweet unto them10 vaughns father tenderly said that even though vaughn was buried at sea the hand of god would take vaughn to his heavenly home11 twentyeight years later president spencer w kimball spoke of vaughn in general conference he said in part i knew this family well i have knelt in mighty prayer with them home training has carried through to the eternal blessing of this large family president kimball challenged every family to be on their knees praying for their sons and daughters twice daily12 brothers and sisters if we faithfully have family prayer scripture study family home evening priesthood blessings and sabbath day observance our children will know what time it is at home they will be prepared for an eternal home in heaven regardless of what befalls them in a difficult world it is vitally important that our children know they are loved and safe at home husbands and wives are equal partners13 they have different but complementary responsibilities the wife may bear children which blesses the entire family the husband may receive the priesthood which blesses the entire family but in family council wives and husbands as equal partners make the most important decisions they decide how the children will be taught and disciplined how money will be spent where they will live and many other family decisions these are made jointly after seeking guidance from the lord the goal is an eternal family the light of christ plants the eternal nature of the family in the hearts of all gods children one of my favorite writers not of our faith said it this way so much in life is extraneous but the family is the real thing the substantial thing the eternal thing the thing to watch over and care for and be loyal to14 the church helps us focus on the savior as a united family in addition to the family the role of the church is also significant the church provides the organization and means for teaching the gospel of jesus christ to all of gods children it provides the priesthood authority to administer the ordinances of salvation and exaltation to all who are worthy and willing to accept them15 in the world there is rampant contention and iniquity and a major emphasis on divergent cultures and inequality in the church except for language units our wards and branches are geographical we dont divide by class or rank16 we rejoice in the fact that all races and cultures are mixed together in a righteous congregation our ward family is important to our progress happiness and personal effort to be more christlike cultures often divide people and are sometimes a source of violence and discrimination17 in the book of mormon some of the most haunting language is used to describe the traditions of wicked fathers which led to violence war evil deeds iniquity and even the destruction of peoples and nations18 there is no better starting point in the scriptures than 4 nephi for a description of the church culture that is essential for all of us in verse 2 it reads in part the people were all converted unto the lord upon all the face of the land both nephites and lamanites and there were no contentions and disputations among them and every man did deal justly one with another in verse 16 we read and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of god the fact that there was no contention was attributed to the love of god which did dwell in the hearts of the people19 this is the culture to which we aspire deep cultural values and beliefs go to the core of who we are traditions of sacrifice gratitude faith and righteousness are to be cherished and preserved families must relish and protect traditions that build faith20 one of the most significant features of any culture is its language in the san francisco california area where i lived there were seven nonnative language units our doctrine with respect to language is set forth in section 90 verse 11 of the doctrine and covenants for it shall come to pass in that day that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue and in his own language when gods children pray to him in their native language that is the language of their heart it is clear that the language of the heart is precious to all people my older brother joseph is a medical doctor and practiced for many years in the san francisco bay area an elderly samoan church member who was a new patient came to his office he was in severe debilitating pain it was determined that he had a kidney stone and appropriate treatment was undertaken this faithful member stated that his original goal was merely to understand what was wrong so he could pray in samoan to his heavenly father about his health problem it is important for members to understand the gospel in the language of their heart so they can pray and act in accordance with gospel principles21 even with diversity of languages and beautiful uplifting cultural traditions we must have hearts knit in unity and love22 the lord has stated emphatically let every man esteem his brother as himself be one and if ye are not one ye are not mine23 while we treasure appropriate cultural diversities our goal is to be united in the culture customs and traditions of the gospel of jesus christ in every respect the church of jesus christ of latterday saints has never been stronger we recognize that some members have questions and concerns as they seek to strengthen their faith and testimonies we should be careful not to be critical or judgmental of those with concernsgreat or small at the same time those with concerns should do everything they can to build their own faith and testimony patiently and humbly studying pondering praying living gospel principles and counseling with appropriate leaders are the best ways to resolve questions or concerns some have asserted that more members are leaving the church today and that there is more doubt and unbelief than in the past this is simply not true the church of jesus christ of latterday saints has never been stronger the number of members removing their names from the records of the church has always been very small and is significantly less in recent years than in the past24 the increase in demonstrably measurable areas such as endowed members with a current temple recommend adult fulltithe payers and those serving missions has been dramatic let me say again the church has never been stronger but remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of god25 we reach out to everyone if the grim realities you are facing at this time seem dark and heavy and almost unbearable remember that in the soulwrenching darkness of gethsemane and the incomprehensible torture and pain of calvary the savior accomplished the atonement which resolves the most terrible burdens that can occur in this life he did it for you and he did it for me he did it because he loves us and because he obeys and loves his father we will be rescued from deatheven from the depths of the sea our protections in this life and for eternity will be in individual and family righteousness church ordinances and following the savior this is our refuge from the storm for those who feel they are alone you can stand resolutely in righteousness knowing that the atonement will protect and bless you beyond your ability to fully understand we should remember the savior keep our covenants and follow the son of god as the young sunflower follows the sunshine following his light and example will bring us joy happiness and peace as psalm 27 and a favorite hymn both proclaim the lord is my light and my salvation26 on this easter weekend as one of the saviors apostles i
