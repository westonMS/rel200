the family is of god by carole m stephens first counselor in the relief society general presidency imagecarole m stephens we each belong to and are needed in the family of god is anything more beautiful and profound than the simple and pure truths of the gospel taught in a primary song and all of you primary girls here tonight know the song i am going to talk about you learned it for your primary program last year in the words of the family is of god1sung earlier in this meetingwe are reminded of pure doctrine we learn not only that the family is of god but also that we are each part of gods family the first line of the song teaches our father has a family its me its you all others too we are his children from the family proclamation we learn in the premortal realm spirit sons and daughters knew and worshipped god as their eternal father in that realm we learned about our eternal female identity we knew that we were each a beloved daughter of heavenly parents2 our mortal journey to earth did not change those truths we each belong to and are needed in the family of god earthly families all look different and while we do the best we can to create strong traditional families membership in the family of god is not contingent upon any kind of statusmarital status parental status financial status social status or even the kind of status we post on social media we belong we are daughters of our heavenly father who loves us and we love him3 the second line of the song expands on the first he sent each one of us to earth through birth to live and learn here in families in the premortal life we learned that we would need a period of mortality we accepted heavenly fathers plan by which his children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize our divine destiny as heirs of eternal life4 elder richard g scott explained that we were taught in the premortal world that our purpose in coming here is to be tested tried and stretched5 that stretching comes in as many forms as there are individuals experiencing it ive never had to live through divorce the pain and insecurity that comes from abandonment or the responsibility associated with being a single mother i havent experienced the death of a child infertility or samegender attraction i havent had to endure abuse chronic illness or addiction these have not been my stretching opportunities so right now some of you are thinking well then sister stephens you just dont understand and i answer that you may be right i dont completely understand your challenges but through my personal tests and trialsthe ones that have brought me to my kneesi have become well acquainted with the one who does understand he who was acquainted with grief6 who experienced all and understands all and in addition i have experienced all of the mortal tests that i just mentioned through the lens of a daughter mother grandmother sister aunt and friend our opportunity as covenantkeeping daughters of god is not just to learn from our own challenges it is to unite in empathy and compassion as we support other members of the family of god in their struggles as we have covenanted to do when we do so we also come to understand and trust that the savior knows the difficulties of the way and can guide us through whatever sorrows and disappointments may come he is true charity and his love endureth forever7in part through us as we follow him as daughters of god and disciples of jesus christ we then act according to those sympathies which god has planted in our hearts8 our sphere of influence isnt limited to our own family members imagesister yellowhair and sister yazzie i recently had the opportunity to visit with sister yazzie of the chinle arizona stake in her hogan when she welcomed me into her home the first thing i noticed was the variety of framed family and missionary photos on her walls and tables so i asked sister yazzie how many grandchildren do you have surprised by my question she shrugged her shoulders confused by her response i looked at her daughter sister yellowhair who answered she doesnt know how many grandchildren she has we dont count all children call her grandmothershe is grandmother to everyone sister yazzie doesnt limit her love and influence to her biological family she understands what it means to expand her sphere of influence as she goes about doing good blessing nurturing and defending the family of god she understands that whenever a woman strengthens the faith of a child she contributes to the strength of a familynow and in the future9 the third line of the song further explains the purpose of our mortality god gave us families to help us become what he wants us to be the savior taught be one and if ye are not one ye are not mine10 the family proclamation teaches that as beloved spirit daughters of heavenly parents we have a divine nature eternal identity and purpose god wants us to be one god needs us to be onecovenantkeeping daughters united in the diversities of our individual lives11 who desire to learn all that is needed to be back in his presence sealed to him as part of his eternal family sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for us to return to the presence of god and for families to be united eternally12 the ordinances we receive and the covenants we make at baptism and in holy temples connect the family of god on both sides of the veilconnecting us to our father through his son who prayed that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us13 as we use our time in mortality to study and apply the saviors teachings we become more like him we come to understand that he is the waythe only waywe can overcome mortal challenges be healed and return back to our heavenly home the final line of the song returns to where it began this is how he shares his love for the family is of god the fathers plan for his children is a plan of love it is a plan to unite his childrenhis familywith him elder russell m nelson taught heavenly father has but two desires for his children immortality and eternal life which means life with him back home14 those desires can be realized only as we also share the love that heavenly father has for his family by reaching out and sharing his plan with others twenty years ago the first presidency and quorum of the twelve apostles reached out to the entire world when issuing a proclamation on the family since then attacks on the family have increased if we are to be successful in our sacred responsibilities as daughters of god we must understand the eternal significance of and our individual responsibility to teach truths about our heavenly fathers plan for his family president howard w hunter explained there is a great need to rally the women of the church to stand with and for the brethren in stemming the tide of evil that surrounds us and in moving forward the work of our savior so we entreat you to minister with your powerful influence for good in strengthening our families our church and our communities15 sisters we
