the book by elder allan f packer of the seventy imageelder allan f packer family history and temple work should be a regular part of our personal worship as a young 12yearold scout i received a gift of a muchdesired addition to my scouting equipment it was a hatchet with a heavy leather cover on the next overnight hike we arrived in camp after dark wet and cold from the heavy snow on the trail all i could think about was building a big roaring fire i immediately went to work chopping a fallen tree with my new hatchet as i chopped i was frustrated because it didnt seem to be cutting very well in my frustration i worked harder disappointed i returned to camp with only a few pieces of wood by the light of someone elses fire i discovered the problem i hadnt taken the cover off the hatchet i can report however the cover was chopped to shreds the lesson i became distracted with other things as we work toward exaltation we must work on all of the requirements and not become distracted by focusing on one or two requirements or other unrelated things seeking the kingdom of god leads to joy and happiness1 if needed we must be willing to change frequent small corrections are less painful and disruptive than large course corrections not long ago sister packer and i traveled to several foreign countries we prepared our passports and other documents we obtained the shots medical exams visas and stamps as we arrived our documents were inspected and when all the requirements were met we were allowed to enter qualifying for exaltation is like entering another country we must each obtain our spiritual passport we do not set the requirements but individually we must meet all of them the plan of salvation contains all of the doctrines laws commandments and ordinances needed for all to qualify for exaltation2 then through the atonement of jesus christ all mankind may be saved3 the church helps but cannot do it for us qualifying for exaltation becomes a quest of a lifetime christ organized his church to help us he has called 15 men we sustain as prophets seers and revelators to guide the church and to teach the people the first presidency4 and the quorum of the twelve apostles5 are of equal power and authority6 with the senior apostle designated as the president of the church the seventy are called to assist7 the leaders did not set the requirements for exaltation god did these leaders are called to teach expound exhort and even warn so that we stay on course8 as explained in the church handbook in fulfilling its purpose to help individuals and families qualify for exaltation the church focuses on divinely appointed responsibilities these include helping members live the gospel of jesus christ gathering israel through missionary work caring for the poor and needy and enabling the salvation of the dead by building temples and performing vicarious ordinances9 these four focuses and all other laws commandments and ordinances are required and not optional through the atonement of jesus christ and by doing each of these we are adding required stamps to our spiritual passports during this conference we are being taught about changes that will help us all be better prepared the family is the center of the plan of salvation and perhaps why it is also called the great plan of happiness10 president boyd k packer has said the ultimate end of all activity in the church is that a man and his wife and their children can be happy at home11 president spencer w kimball said our success individually and as a church will largely be determined by how faithfully we focus on living the gospel in the home12 temple and family history work is part of living the gospel at home it should be a family activity far more than a church activity there has been a renewed emphasis on family history and temple work from the first presidency and the quorum of the twelve13 your response to this emphasis will increase your individual and family joy and happiness from the doctrine and covenants we read the great day of the lord is at hand let us therefore as a church and a people and as latterday saints offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness and let us present in his holy temple a book containing the records of our dead which shall be worthy of all acceptation14 this book will be prepared using the records of names and ordinances in the churchs familytree database i am checking and adding records to this database because i want the names of all those i love to be in the book dont you doctrine and covenants section 128 says for we without our ancestors cannot be made perfect neither can they without us be made perfect15 family history is more than genealogy rules names dates and places it is more than a focus on the past family history also includes the present as we create our own history it includes the future as we shape future history through our descendants a young mother for example sharing her family stories and pictures with her children is doing family history work like partaking of the sacrament attending meetings reading the scriptures and saying personal prayers doing family history and temple work should be a regular part of our personal worship the response of our youth and others to prophetic invitations has been inspiring and proves this work can and should be done by all members at any age as elder quentin l cook explained we now have the doctrine the temples and the technology16 doing the work now is much easier and limited only by the number of members who make this a priority the work still takes time and sacrifice but all can do it and with relative ease compared to just a few years ago to assist members the church has gathered records and provided tools so that much of the work can be done in our own homes or in the ward buildings and the temple most obstacles have been removed whatever your past perception it is different now however there is one obstacle the church cannot remove it is an individuals hesitation to do the work all it requires is a decision and a little effort it does not require a large block of time just a little time on a consistent basis will yield the joy of the work make the decision to take a step to learn and ask others to help you they will the names you find and take to the temple will become the records for the book17 even with the dramatic increase in member participation we find that relatively few members of the church are regularly involved in finding and doing temple ordinances for their family18 this calls for a change in our priorities dont fight the change embrace it change is part of the great plan of happiness this work needs to be done not for the benefit of the church but for our dead and for ourselves we and our deceased ancestors need the stamps in our spiritual passports the welding together19 of our families across generations can occur only in the temples through the sealing ordinances the steps are simple just find a name and take it to the temple over time you will be able to help others do it also with few exceptions everyoneeveryonecan do this there are tangible blessings which attend this work many parents and leaders are concerned about current world conditions and the impact on families and youth elder david a bednar has promised i invite the young people of the church to learn about and experience the spirit of elijah i promise that you will be protected against the intensifying influence of the adversary as you participate in and love this holy work you will be safeguarded in your youth and throughout your lives20 brothers and sisters its time to take the cover off our hatchets and go to work we must not sacrifice our exaltation or that of our families for less important interests this is the work of god to be done by members and nonmembers alike young and old male and female i close quoting the first verse of hymn 324 changing one word
