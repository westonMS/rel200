parents the prime gospel teachers of their children by tad r callister sunday school general president imagetad r callister when all is said and done the home is the ideal forum for teaching the gospel of jesus christ ben carson said of himself i was the worst student in my whole fifthgrade class one day ben took a math test with 30 problems the student behind him corrected it and handed it back the teacher mrs williamson started calling each students name for the score finally she got to ben out of embarrassment he mumbled the answer mrs williamson thinking he had said 9 replied that for ben to score 9 out of 30 was a wonderful improvement the student behind ben then yelled out not nine he got none right ben said he wanted to drop through the floor at the same time bens mother sonya faced obstacles of her own she was one of 24 children had only a thirdgrade education and could not read she was married at age 13 was divorced had two sons and was raising them in the ghettos of detroit nonetheless she was fiercely selfreliant and had a firm belief that god would help her and her sons if they did their part one day a turning point came in her life and that of her sons it dawned on her that successful people for whom she cleaned homes had librariesthey read after work she went home and turned off the television that ben and his brother were watching she said in essence you boys are watching too much television from now on you can watch three programs a week in your free time you will go to the libraryread two books a week and give me a report the boys were shocked ben said he had never read a book in his entire life except when required to do so at school they protested they complained they argued but it was to no avail then ben reflected she laid down the law i didnt like the rule but her determination to see us improve changed the course of my life and what a change it made by the seventh grade he was at the top of his class he went on to attend yale university on a scholarship then johns hopkins medical school where at age 33 he became its chief of pediatric neurosurgery and a worldrenowned surgeon how was that possible largely because of a mother who without many of the advantages of life magnified her calling as a parent1 the scriptures speak of the role of parentsthat it is their duty to teach their children the doctrine of repentance faith in christ the son of the living god and of baptism and the gift of the holy ghost dc 6825 as parents we are to be the prime gospel teachers and examples for our childrennot the bishop the sunday school the young women or young men but the parents as their prime gospel teachers we can teach them the power and reality of the atonementof their identity and divine destinyand in so doing give them a rock foundation upon which to build when all is said and done the home is the ideal forum for teaching the gospel of jesus christ about a year ago i was on assignment in beirut lebanon while there i learned about a 12yearold girl sarah her parents and two older siblings had converted to the church in romania but were then required to return to their homeland when sarah was just 7 years of age in their homeland there was no church presence no organized units no sunday school or young women program after five years this family learned of a branch in beirut and just before i arrived sent their 12yearold daughter sarah accompanied by older siblings to be baptized while there i gave a devotional on the plan of salvation with some frequency sarah raised her hand and answered the questions after the meeting and knowing of her almost nonexistent church exposure i approached her and asked sarah how did you know the answers to those questions she immediately replied my mother taught me they did not have the church in their community but they did have the gospel in their home her mother was her prime gospel teacher it was enos who said the words which i had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life and the joy of the saints sunk deep into my heart enos 13 there is no question who enoss prime gospel teacher was i remember my father stretched out by the fireplace reading the scriptures and other good books and i would stretch out by his side i remember the cards he would keep in his shirt pocket with quotes of the scriptures and shakespeare and new words that he would memorize and learn i remember the gospel questions and discussions at the dinner table i remember the many times my father took me to visit the elderlyhow we would stop by to pick up ice cream for one or a chicken dinner for another or his final handshake with some money enclosed i remember the good feeling and the desire to be like him i remember my mother age 90 or so cooking in her condominium kitchen and then exiting with a tray of food i asked her where she was going she replied oh i am taking some food to the elderly i thought to myself mother you are the elderly i can never express enough gratitude for my parents who were my prime gospel teachers one of the most meaningful things we can do as parents is teach our children the power of prayer not just the routine of prayer when i was about 17 years of age i was kneeling by my bed saying my evening prayers unbeknown to me my mother was standing in the doorway when i finished she said tad are you asking the lord to help you find a good wife her question caught me totally off guard that was the furthest thing from my mind i was thinking about basketball and school and so i replied no to which she responded well you should son it will be the most important decision you will ever make those words sunk deep into my heart and so for the next six years i prayed that god would help me find a good wife and oh how he answered that prayer as parents we can teach our children to pray for things of eternal consequenceto pray for the strength to be morally clean in a very challenging world to be obedient and to have the courage to stand for the right no doubt most of our youth have their evening prayers but perhaps many of them struggle with the habit of personal morning prayer as parents as their prime gospel teachers we can correct this which parent in book of mormon times would have let their sons march out to the front of battle without a breastplate and shield and sword to protect them against the potentially mortal blows of the enemy but how many of us let our children march out the front door each morning to the most dangerous of all battlefields to face satan and his myriad of temptations without their spiritual breastplate and shield and sword that come from the protective power of prayer the lord said pray always that you may conquer satan dc 105 as parents we can help instill within our children the habit and power of morning prayer we can also teach our children to use their time wisely on occasion like sonya carson we will need to put our foot lovingly but firmly down to restrict our childrens time with television and other electronic devices that in many cases are monopolizing their lives instead we may need to redirect their time into more productive gospeloriented efforts there may be some initial resistance some complaining but like sonya carson we need to have the vision and the will to stick with it one day our children will understand and appreciate what we have done if we do not do this who will we might all ask ourselves do our children receive our best spiritual intellectual and creative efforts or do they receive our leftover time and talents after we have given our all to our church calling or professional pursuits in the life to come i do not know if titles such as bishop or relief society president will survive but i do know that the titles of husband and wife father and mother will continue and be revered worlds without end that is one reason it is so important to honor our responsibilities as parents here on earth so we can prepare for those even greater but similar responsibilities in the life to come as parents we can proceed with the assurance god will never leave us alone god never gives us a responsibility without offering divine aidof that i can testify may we in our divine role as parents and in partnership with god become the prime gospel teachers and examples for our children i so pray in the name of jesus christ amen note see ben carson gifted hands the ben carson story 1990
