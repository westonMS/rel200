for the sake of your posterity by elder carlos a godoy of the presidency of the seventy dont be the weak link in this beautiful chain of faith you started or you received as a legacy be the strong one a few years ago when i was serving in the south america northwest area and living in peru i had a beautiful experience that i would like to share with you it happened when i was returning home after a busy weekend of assignments after finally completing the airport immigration process i found a friendly taxi driver waiting for me from our usual taxi service he took me to his car and i sat in the back ready to relax and enjoy a quiet trip home after driving a few blocks the driver received a phone call from his supervisor telling him i took the wrong taxi a different car was reserved for me and the supervisor asked him to take me back to the airport if i wanted to change cars i told him it was not necessary and we could keep going after a few minutes of silence he looked at me through the rearview mirror and asked you are a mormon arent you well after that inviting question i knew my quiet moments were over i could not resist exploring where his question would take us i learned that his name was omar his wifes name was maria teresa and they had two childrencarolina age 14 and rodrigo age 10 omar had been a member of the church since he was a child his family was active but at some point his parents stopped going to church omar became completely inactive when he was 15 he was then 40 years old at that moment i realized i did not take the wrong taxi it was not a coincidence i told him who i was and that i was in his taxi because the lord was calling him back to his fold we then talked about the time he and his family were active members of the church he had fond memories of sweet family home evening moments and some primary songs he then softly sang a few words of i am a child of god1 after getting his address phone number and permission to share with his bishop i told him i would find a way to be in the chapel on his first day back to church we finished our trip from the airport to my home as well as our little trip to his past and we went our separate ways a few weeks later his bishop called me telling me omar was planning to attend church on a certain sunday i told him i would be there that sunday omar was there with his son his wife and daughter were not yet interested a few months later his bishop called me again this time to tell me that omar would be baptizing his wife and his two children and he invited me to be there here is the picture of that sunday where they were confirmed members of the church imageelder godoy with omars family the sunday they were confirmed that same sunday i told omar and his family that if they were prepared in one year i would be honored to perform their sealing in the lima peru temple here is a picture of that memorable moment for all of us taken one year later imageelder godoy with omars family at the temple why am i sharing this experience with you i am sharing it for two purposes first to address those good members who for some reason have fallen away from the restored gospel of jesus christ second to also address those participating members today who maybe are not being as faithful to their covenants as they should be in both cases generations ahead of them are impacted and blessings and promises that were reserved for their posterities are at risk lets start with the first scenario good members who have left the covenant path as happened with my peruvian friend omar when i asked him why he decided to return he said it was because he and his wife felt their children would be happier in life with the gospel of jesus christ he felt it was about time to go back to church for the sake of their children it is so sad when we come across inactive members or nonmembers of the church who at one time had the gospel within their families and lost it because of their parents or grandparents decision to take a break from the church that decision could have an impact on their posterity forever their children and grandchildren have been precluded from the protection and the blessings of the gospel of jesus christ in their lives even more heartbreaking they have lost the promises of an eternal family which were there one day the decision of one has impacted a whole chain of descendants a legacy of faith has been broken however as we know anything broken can be mended through jesus christ for this reason please consider this invitation from president russell m nelson now if you have stepped off the path may i invite you with all the hope in my heart to please come back whatever your concerns whatever your challenges there is a place for you in this the lords church you and generations yet unborn will be blessed by your actions now to return to the covenant path2 now lets address the second scenario todays participating members who maybe are not being as faithful as they should be just as yesterdays decisions impact todays realities decisions of today will impact our future and the future of our family members president dallin h oaks taught us the restored gospel of jesus christ encourages us to think about the future it teaches great ideas about the future to guide our actions today in contrast we all know persons who are concerned only with the present spend it today enjoy it today and take no thought for the future as we make current decisions we should always be asking where will this lead3 will our current decisions lead us to joy now and in eternity or will they lead us to sorrow and tears some may think we dont need to attend church every sunday or we will pay tithing when things get better or i will not support the church leaders in this subject but they say we know the church is true and we will never leave the gospel of jesus christ those with thoughts like these do not realize the negative impact this lukewarm type of membership will have on their lives and on the lives of their posterity the parents may remain active but the risk of losing their children is highin this life and in eternity regarding those who will not inherit celestial glory with their families the lord says these are they who are not valiant in the testimony of jesus wherefore they obtain not the crown over the kingdom of our god4 is that what we want for ourselves or our children shouldnt we be more valiant and less lukewarm for our own sake and for the sake of our posterity president m russell ballard also addressed a similar concern for some christs invitation to believe and remain continues to be hard some disciples struggle to understand a specific church policy or teaching others find concerns in our history or in the imperfections of some members and leaders past and present the decision to walk no more with church members and the lords chosen leaders will have a longterm impact that cannot always be seen right now5 what a sad legacy to pass alongand for what reason whatever it is it isnt enough to ignore the negative spiritual impact it will create for generations ahead my dear brothers and sisters if you are going through one of these two situations i mentioned in my message please reconsider your course of action you know there is a plan for us in this life you know that families can be eternal why put yours at risk dont be the weak link in this beautiful chain of faith you started or you received as a legacy be the strong one it is your turn to do it and the lord can help you from the bottom of my heart i invite you to think about it to look ahead and evaluate where this will lead and if necessary to be valiant enough to reshape your path for the sake of your posterity in the name of jesus christ amen notes i am a child of god hymns no 301 russell m nelson as we go forward together ensign or liahona apr 2018 7 emphasis added dallin h oaks where will this
