this is my work and glory by elder m russell ballard of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder m russell ballard god has freely given his power to those who accept and honor his priesthood which leads to the promised blessings of immortality and eternal life president packer were all looking forward to the 98 version of that wonderful poem what a wonderful instruction he gave to us a few weeks ago on a cold dark winters night my wife barbara and i looked in awe up at the sky the millions of stars seemed exceptionally bright and beautiful i then turned to the pearl of great price and read again with wonder what the lord god said to moses and worlds without number have i created and i also created them for mine own purpose and by the son i created them which is mine only begotten moses 133 in our day the hubble deepspace telescope has confirmed the magnitude of what moses saw hubble scientists say the milky way galaxy of which our earth and sun are just a tiny part is estimated to be only one of over 200 billion similar galaxies for me it is difficult to comprehend impossible to fathom so large and so vast are gods creations brothers and sisters the power by which the heavens and earth were and are created is the priesthood those of us who are members of the church know that the source of this priesthood power is god almighty and his son jesus christ not only is the priesthood the power by which the heavens and the earth were created but it is also the power the savior used in his mortal ministry to perform miracles to bless and heal the sick to bring the dead to life and as our fathers only begotten son to endure the unbearable pain of gethsemane and calvarythus fulfilling the laws of justice with mercy and providing an infinite atonement and overcoming physical death through the resurrection it is the keys of this priesthood authority and resultant power that he gave to peter james and john and his other apostles to bless others and to bind in heaven that which is bound on earth the power of the priesthood is a sacred and essential gift of god it is different from priesthood authority which is the authorization to act in gods name the authorization or ordination is given by the laying on of hands the power of the priesthood comes only when those who exercise it are worthy and acting in accordance with gods will as president spencer w kimball declared the lord has given to all of us as holders of the priesthood certain of his authority but we can only tap the powers of heaven on the basis of our personal righteousness boys need heroes close by ensign may 1976 45 during the glorious days of the restoration and the reestablishment of the church of jesus christ in the world today john the baptist peter james and john moses elias and elijah came to the earth and restored through the prophet joseph smith all of the keys and authority of the priesthood for the work of god in these latter days it is by these keys this authority and this power that the church of jesus christ is organized today with christ at the head directing his living prophet thomas s monson and assisted by duly called and ordained apostles in our heavenly fathers great priesthoodendowed plan men have the unique responsibility to administer the priesthood but they are not the priesthood men and women have different but equally valued roles just as a woman cannot conceive a child without a man so a man cannot fully exercise the power of the priesthood to establish an eternal family without a woman in other words in the eternal perspective both the procreative power and the priesthood power are shared by husband and wife and as husband and wife a man and a woman should strive to follow our heavenly father the christian virtues of love humility and patience should be their focus as they seek the blessings of the priesthood in their lives and for their family it is crucial for us to understand that heavenly father has provided a way for all of his sons and his daughters to have access to the blessings of and be strengthened by the power of the priesthood central to gods plan for his spirit children is his own declaration this is my work and my gloryto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man moses 139 in the revelation given to the prophet joseph smith in section 81 of the doctrine and covenants the lord explains that the power of the priesthood is to be used to succor the weak lift up the hands which hang down and strengthen the feeble knees verse 5 and in doing such things thou wilt do the greatest good unto thy fellow beings and wilt promote the glory of him who is your lord dc 814 as we think about the imagery of succoring the weak lifting up the hands which hang down and strengthening feeble knees i am reminded of a sweet sevenyearold showing her grandfather a small tomato plant she had started from seed as part of a secondgrade school project she explained that from one tiny seed would come a plant and if the plant were cared for it would grow many tomatoes that would each have many seeds she said and if all of those seeds were planted and grew more tomatoes and you planted all of those seeds in a few seasons you would have millions of tomatoes all she said in amazement from one little seed but then she said i almost killed my plant i left it in a dark room and forgot to water it when i remembered the plant it was all wilted and dead looking i cried because i thought of all of those millions of tomatoes that would never grow she was then excited to tell her grandfather about the miracle that happened she explained momma said maybe the plant wasnt dead maybe all it needed was some water and some light to bring life back and she was right i gave the plant some water and i put it in the window for light and guess what she asked it came back to life and now its going to grow millions of tomatoes her small tomato plant so full of potential but so weakened and wilted from unintentional neglect was strengthened and revived through the simple ministration of water and light by the little girls loving and caring hands brothers and sisters as the literal spirit children of our loving heavenly father we have unlimited divine potential but if we are not careful we can become like the wilted tomato plant we can drift away from the true doctrine and gospel of christ and become spiritually undernourished and wilted having removed ourselves from the divine light and living waters of the saviors eternal love and priesthood power those who hold the priesthood and fail to constantly strive to honor it by serving our families and others will be like those who do not receive the blessings inherent in the power of the priesthood and will surely wilt spiritually having deprived themselves of the essential spiritual nutrients light and power of god in their livesmuch like the tomato plant so full of potential but neglected and wilted the same priesthood power that created worlds galaxies and the universe can and should be part of our lives to succor strengthen and bless our families our friends and our neighborsin other words to do the things that the savior would do if he were ministering among us today and the primary purpose of this priesthood power is to bless sanctify and purify us so we can live together with our families in the presence of our heavenly parents bound by priesthood sealings participating in the marvelous work of god and jesus christ in forever expanding their light and glory to this end a few months ago i

shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life john 414 i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall have the light of life john 812 if any one of you feels your faith or your testimony of heavenly fathers plan is less than you know it should be then turn more fully to the savior let his light and his living water do for you and your family what a little water and light did in bringing life back to the weakened tomato plant now i began with the wonder and awe in the creations of god through the power of the priesthood i stand here wondering as i suppose most of you also do if gods power to instruct and bless us can ever be fully comprehended it is so great so majestic so powerful joseph smith said the priesthood is an everlasting principle and existed with god from eternity and will to eternity without beginning of days or end of years teachings of presidents of the church joseph smith 2007 104 god has freely given his power to those who accept and honor his priesthood which leads to the promised blessings of immortality and eternal life i testify that the work of jesus christ is accomplished through the priesthood it is the power by which our heavenly father and his beloved son created this earth and set in motion the great plan of happiness for our sakes may we be wise and seek to strengthen our own lives the lives of our families and the church of jesus christ of latterday saints through the power of the priesthood of god is my humble prayer in the name of jesus christ amen
