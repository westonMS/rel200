these things i know by president boyd k packer president of the quorum of the twelve apostles imagepresident boyd k packer of all that i have read and taught and learned the one most precious and sacred truth that i have to offer is my special witness of jesus christ in 1992 having served nine years as an assistant to the twelve and 22 years as a member of the twelve i reached the age of 68 i felt impressed to start what i called an unfinished composition the first part of that work goes like this i had a thought the other night a thought profound and deep it came when i was too worn down too tired to go to sleep id had a very busy day and pondered on my fate the thought was this when i was young i wasnt 68 i could walk without a limp i had no shoulder pain i could read a line through twice and quote it back again i could work for endless hours and hardly stop to breathe and things that now i cannot do i mastered then with ease if i could now turn back the years if that were mine to choose i would not barter age for youth id have too much to lose i am quite content to move ahead to yield my youth however grand the thing id lose if i went back is what i understand ten years later i decided to add a few more lines to that poem ten years have flown to who knows where and with them much of pain a metal hip erased my limp i walk quite straight again another plate holds neck bones fast a wonderful creation it backed my polio away ive joined the stiffnecked generation the signs of aging can be seen those things will not get better the only thing that grows in strength with me is my forgetter you ask do i remember you of course youre much the same now dont go getting all upset if i cant recall your name i would agree ive learned some things i did not want to know but age has brought those precious truths that make the spirit grow of all the blessings that have come the best thing in my life is the companionship and comfort i get from my dear wife our children all have married well with families of their own with children and grandchildren how soon they all have grown i have not changed my mind one bit about regaining youth were meant to age for with it comes a knowledge of the truth you ask what will the future bring just what will be my fate ill go along and not complain ask when im 88 and last year i added these lines and now you see im 88 the years have flown so fast i walked i limped i held a cane and now i ride at last i take a nap now and again but priesthood power remains for all the physical things i lack there are great spiritual gains i have traveled the world a million miles and another million too and with the help of satellites my journeys are not through i now can say with all certainty that i know and love the lord i can testify with them of old as i preach his holy word i know what he felt in gethsemane is too much to comprehend i know he did it all for us we have no greater friend i know that he will come anew with power and in glory i know i will see him once again at the end of my lifes story ill kneel before his wounded feet ill feel his spirit glow my whispering quivering voice will say my lord my god i know1 and i do know the back windows of our home overlook a small flower garden and the woods which border a small stream one wall of the house borders on the garden and is thickly covered with english ivy most years this ivy has been the nesting place for house finches the nests in the vines are safe from foxes and raccoons and cats that are about one day there was a great commotion in the ivy desperate cries of distress came as 8 or 10 finches from the surrounding woods came to join in this cry of alarm i soon saw the source of the commotion a snake had slid partway down out of the ivy and hung in front of the window just long enough for me to pull it out the middle part of the snakes body had two bulgesclear evidence convicting it of taking two fledglings from the nest not in the 50 years we had lived in our home had we seen anything like that it was a onceinalifetime experienceor so we thought a few days later there was another commotion this time in the vines covering our dog run we heard the same cries of alarm the gathering of the neighborhood finches we knew what the predator was a grandson climbed onto the run and pulled out another snake that was still holding on tightly to the mother bird it had caught in the nest and killed i said to myself what is going on is the garden of eden being invaded again there came into my mind the warnings spoken by the prophets we will not always be safe from the adversarys influence even within our own homes we need to protect our nestlings we live in a very dangerous world that threatens those things that are most spiritual the family the fundamental organization in time and eternity is under attack from forces seen and unseen the adversary is about his objective is to cause injury if he can weaken and destroy the family he will have succeeded latterday saints recognize the transcendent importance of the family and strive to live in such a way that the adversary cannot steal into our homes we find safety and security for ourselves and our children in honoring the covenants we have made and living up to the ordinary acts of obedience required of the followers of christ isaiah said the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever2 that peace is also promised in the revelations in which the lord declares if ye are prepared ye shall not fear3 the consummate power of the priesthood has been given to protect the home and its inhabitants the father has the authority and responsibility to teach his children and to bless and to provide for them the ordinances of the gospel and every other priesthood protection necessary he is to demonstrate love and fidelity and honor to the mother so that their children can see that love i have come to know that faith is a real power not just an expression of belief there are few things more powerful than the faithful prayers of a righteous mother teach yourself and teach your families about the gift of the holy ghost and the atonement of jesus christ you will do no greater eternal work than within the walls of your own home we know that we are spirit children of heavenly parents here on earth to receive our mortal bodies and to be tested we who have mortal bodies have the power over the beings who do not4 we are free to choose what we will and to pick and choose our acts but we are not free to choose the consequences they come as they will come agency is defined in the scriptures as moral agency which means that we can choose between good and evil the adversary seeks to tempt us to misuse our moral agency the scriptures teach us that every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity according to the moral agency which i have given unto him that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment5 alma taught that the lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance6 in order to understand this we must separate the sin from the sinner for example when they brought before the savior a woman taken in adultery obviously guilty he dismissed the case with five words go and sin no more7 that is the spirit of his ministry tolerance is a virtue but like all virtues when exaggerated it transforms itself into a vice we need to be careful of the tolerance trap so that we are not swallowed up in it the permissiveness afforded by the weakening of the laws of the land to tolerate legalized acts of immorality does not reduce the serious spiritual consequence that is the result of the violation of gods law of chastity all are born with the light of christ a guiding influence which permits each person to recognize right from wrong what we do with that light and how we respond to those promptings to live righteously is part of the test of mortality for behold the spirit of christ is given to every man that he may know good from evil wherefore i show unto you the way to judge for every thing which inviteth to do good and to persuade to believe in christ is sent forth by the power and gift of christ wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of god8 each of us must stay in condition to respond to inspiration and the promptings of the holy ghost the lord has a way of pouring pure intelligence into our minds to prompt us to guide us to teach us and to warn us each son or daughter of god can know the things they need to know instantly learn to receive and act on inspiration and revelation of all that i have read and taught and learned the one most precious and sacred truth that i have to offer is my special witness of jesus christ he lives i know he lives i am his witness and of him i can testify he is our savior our redeemer of this i am certain of this i bear witness in the name of jesus christ amen
