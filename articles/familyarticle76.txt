beware concerning yourselves by elder anthony d perkins of the seventy imageelder anthony d perkins stay on the priesthood path by deepening your conversion and strengthening your family avoid tragedy by heeding spiritual beware signs placed along our way by god and prophets when i was a young man our family would drive over americas rocky mountains to visit grandparents the road began in sagebrush flatlands ascended through steep pinecovered slopes and ultimately emerged into aspen groves and mountaintop meadows where we could see almost forever but this beautiful road was not perfectly safe much of the highway was carved into the steep mountainside to protect travelers road builders constructed guardrails and placed signs that read beware falling rocks we observed ample reason for these warnings rocks and boulders were strewn along the riverbed far below the road occasionally we could see crumpled cars on the canyon bottom a tragic record of drivers who failed to beware oath and covenant of the priesthood brethren each of you has entered or will soon enter into the oath and covenant of the melchizedek priesthood1 in that covenant is embedded a glorious journey that begins with receiving both the lesser and higher priesthoods progresses through magnifying our callings and climbs ever upward to gods grandest vistas until we receive all that the father hath2 the wise designer of that celestial road has erected caution signs for our journey the oath and covenant of the priesthood contains this soulsearching warning i now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves3 why would god command us to beware he knows that satan is an actual being4 who seeks to drag down our souls into the gulf of misery5 god also knows that lurking within priesthood holders is a natural man6 prone to wander7 thus prophets invite us to put off the old man8 and put on christ9 through faith repentance saving ordinances and daily gospel living avoiding tragedy while ascending the priesthood path any boy or man can be dragged down if he fails to beware have you been stunned and heartbroken by the unexpected fall of an outstanding young man newly returned missionary respected priesthood leader or beloved family member the old testament story of david is a tragic example of squandered priesthood power although he defeated goliath while young and lived righteously for decades10 this prophetking was still spiritually vulnerable in that crucial moment when from his rooftop he saw beautiful bathsheba bathing no moral lifeguard stood near to shout beware david you fool his failure to beware concerning himself11 and to act on promptings of the spirit12 led to the loss of his eternal family13 brethren if even mighty david can be swept off the road to exaltation how can we avoid a similar fate the twin guardrails of deep personal conversion and strong family relations help keep us on the heavenly highway knowing this satan dislodges conversioncrushing and familyfracturing boulders to cross our priesthood path thankfully jesus christ and his prophets have placed beware signs along the way they consistently warn us of conversioncrushing pride14 and familyfracturing sins such as anger greed and lust long ago moses counseled beware lest thou forget the lord15 in our fastpaced and entertainmentsaturated world men are still quick to forget the lord to do iniquity and to be led away by the evil one16 deepen conversion and strengthen family to stay safely on the priesthood path amid rock slides of temptation i remind us of six fundamental principles that deepen conversion and strengthen family first praying always opens the door for divine help to conquer satan17 each time jesus alerts priesthood holders to beware for satan desireth to sift you he prescribes prayer as the temptationcountering action18 president thomas s monson has taught if any of us has been slow to hearken to the counsel to pray always there is no finer hour to begin than now a man never stands taller than when he is upon his knees19 second studying ancient and modern scripture connects us to god the lord cautioned church members to beware how they hold the prophets lest they are accounted as a light thing and are brought under condemnation thereby and stumble and fall20 to avoid this sobering condemnation we should diligently read the scriptures as well as church magazines and websites that enable us to be counseled in an intimate and personal way by the lords chosen prophet21 third worthily participating in ordinances prepares us to take the holy spirit for our guide22 when the savior warned beware lest ye are deceived he promised we will not be if we seek earnestly the best gifts of the spirit23 worthily partaking of the sacrament each week qualifies members to always have his spirit to be with them24 in temple worship we may receive a fulness of the holy ghost25 fourth showing genuine love is at the heart of personal conversion and family relations king benjamin directed beware lest there shall arise contentions among you26 never forget that satan is the father of contention27 and seeks that family members fight and quarrel28 brethren if we are emotionally verbally or physically abusive to any member of our family or bully any person then we lose priesthood power29 choose to control anger family members should hear blessings from our mouths not cursings we are to influence others only by persuasion longsuffering gentleness meekness love unfeigned kindness and charity30 fifth obeying the law of tithing is an essential element of faith and family unity because satan uses greed and the pursuit of possessions to sweep families off the celestial highway jesus advised beware of covetousness31 covetousness is restrained as we project our income pay an honest tithe and generous fast offering budget needed expenses avoid unnecessary debt save for future needs and become temporally selfreliant gods promise to us is seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you32 sixth fully living the law of chastity yields confidence to stand in the presence of god with the holy ghost as our constant companion33 satan is assaulting virtue and marriage with an avalanche of obscenity when the lord warned adulterers to beware and repent speedily his definition extended beyond the physical act of adultery to the lustful thoughts that precede it34 modern prophets and apostles have spoken often and clearly about the plague of pornography president gordon b hinckley taught pornography is like a raging storm destroying individuals and families utterly ruining what was once wholesome and beautiful the time has come for any one of us who is so involved to pull himself out of the mire35 if you are tempted to violate the law of chastity in any form follow joseph of egypts example who fled and got him out36 these six fundamental principles help priesthood holders continue up the heavenly highway safely between the spiritual guardrails of personal conversion and family relationships young men obeying these principles will prepare you for temple covenants fulltime missionary service and eternal marriage husbands and fathers living these principles will qualify you to preside over the home in righteousness serving as your familys spiritual leader with your wife as an equal partner37 the priesthood path is a journey filled with joy staying on the priesthood path returning to my experiences as a young man i remember one crossing of the rocky mountains after passing a beware falling rocks sign my father noticed pebbles and small stones landing on the pavement in front of us he quickly slowed the car to a near stop just as a basketballsized boulder whizzed by us dad waited for the rock slide to cease before continuing my fathers constant attention and immediate action ensured that our family safely reached our final destination brethren satan seeks to destroy the souls of men38 if your soul is drifting to the edge of a spiritual cliff stop now before you fall and steer back on course39 if you feel your soul lies wrecked at the bottom of a canyon rather than high on the priesthood path because you neglected beware signs and sinned i testify that through sincere repentance and the power of jesus christs atoning sacrifice you can be lifted up and restored to gods heavenly highway40 jesus taught beware ye of hypocrisy41 if you are unworthy to exercise the priesthood please meet with your bishop who can help you repent take courage that although the savior affirms beware and refrain from sin42 he also promises i the lord forgive you go your ways and sin no more43 i invite every boy and man to stay on the priesthood path by deepening your conversion and strengthening your family prayers scriptures and ordinances deepen conversion love tithing and chastity strengthen family avoid tragedy by heeding spiritual beware signs placed along our way by god and prophets strive to follow the perfect example of jesus christ who suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them44 i promise that if men keep the priesthood covenant to beware concerning yourselves45 we and our families can be assured of safely and joyfully reaching our exalted destination in the celestial kingdom i so testify in the sacred name of jesus christ amen notes see doctrine and covenants 843344 doctrine and covenants 8438 doctrine and covenants 8443 see joseph smithhistory 116 see also moses 11222 see helaman 512 see also 2
