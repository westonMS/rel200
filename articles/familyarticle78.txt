the vision of prophets regarding relief society faith family relief by julie b beck recently released relief society general president imagejulie b beck faith family and reliefthese three simple words have come to express the vision of prophets for sisters in the church in recent years i have been impressed to speak often about relief societyits purposes and qualities1 the value of its history2 its work and its partnership with bishops and melchizedek priesthood quorums3 it seems important now to focus some attention on the vision of prophets regarding relief society4 just as the lords prophets have continually taught elders and high priests their purposes and duties they have shared their vision for the sisters of the relief society from their counsel it is clear that the purposes of relief society are to increase faith and personal righteousness strengthen families and homes and seek out and help those in need faith family and reliefthese three simple words have come to express the vision of prophets for sisters in the church since the beginning of the restoration prophets have shared their vision of strong faithful purposeful women who understand their eternal value and purpose when the prophet joseph smith established relief society he directed its first president to preside over this society in taking care of the pooradministering to their wants and attending to the various affairs of this institution5 he envisioned the organization as a select society separate from all the evils of the world6 brigham young the second president of the church instructed his counselors and the quorum of the twelve apostles to direct bishops to let the sisters organize female relief societies in the various wards he added some may think this is a trifling thing but it is not7 later president joseph f smith said that in contrast to worldly organizations which are menmade or womenmade the relief society is divinely made divinely authorized divinely instituted divinely ordained of god8 president joseph fielding smith told the sisters that they had been given power and authority to do a great many things9 he said you are members of the greatest womens organization in the world an organization which is a vital part of the kingdom of god on the earth and which is so designed and operated that it helps its faithful members to gain eternal life in our fathers kingdom10 an extensive sphere of influence every year hundreds of thousands of women and young women become part of this everexpanding circle of sisters11 thereafter wherever a sister lives and wherever she serves she retains her membership and association in relief society12 because of relief societys important purposes the first presidency has expressed their desire that young women begin their preparation for relief society well before they are 18 years old13 relief society is not a program it is an official part of the lords church that is divinely ordained of god to teach strengthen and inspire sisters in their purpose regarding faith family and relief relief society is a way of life for latterday saint women and its influence extends far beyond a sunday class or a social gathering it follows the pattern of female disciples who served with the lord jesus christ and his apostles in his ancient church14 we have been taught that it is as obligatory upon a woman to draw into her life the virtues that are fostered by the relief society as it is an obligation for the men to build into their lives the patterns of character fostered by the priesthood15 when the prophet joseph smith organized the relief society he taught the sisters that they were to relieve the poor and save souls16 in their charge to save souls sisters were authorized to organize and participate in an extensive sphere of influence the first relief society president was set apart to expound the scriptures and relief society still carries an essential teaching responsibility in the lords church when joseph smith told the sisters that the organization of relief society would prepare them for the privileges blessings and gifts of the priesthood17 the lords work of salvation was opened to them saving souls includes sharing the gospel and participating in missionary work it includes engaging in temple and family history work it includes doing everything possible to become spiritually and temporally selfreliant elder john a widtsoe declared that relief society offers relief of poverty relief of illness relief of doubt relief of ignorancerelief of all that hinders the joy and progress of woman what a magnificent commission18 president boyd k packer has likened relief society to a protecting wall19 the responsibility to protect sisters and their families increases the significance of the watchcare and ministering of visiting teachers and it is a demonstration of our willingness to remember our covenants with the lord as ministers to the needy and to the afflicted we work in harmony with bishops to look after the temporal and spiritual needs of the saints20 president spencer w kimball said there are many sisters who are living in ragsspiritual rags they are entitled to gorgeous robes spiritual robes it is your privilege to go into homes and exchange robes for rags21 president harold b lee shared this vision he said cannot you see why the lord has put it upon the relief society to visit these homes because next to the master himself there are none in the church who have a more lovely touch a more complete understanding of the hearts and the lives of these individuals22 president joseph f smith cautioned relief society sisters and their leaders saying that he did not want to see the time when our relief societies will follow or commingle and lose their own identity by mixing up with womanmade organizations he expected the sisters to lead the world and especially the women of the world in everything that is praiseworthy everything that is godlike everything that is uplifting and that is purifying to the children of men23 his counsel emphasizes the charge to eliminate traditions themes fads and trends and incorporate practices that are consistent with relief society purposes leaders who seek revelation can ensure that every meeting lesson class activity and effort of the relief society fulfills the purposes for which it was organized the sociality friendship and unity we desire will be the sweet results of serving together with the lord in his work fulfilling the vision of prophets president thomas s monson and his counselors recently testified that the lord has restored the fulness of the gospel through the prophet joseph smith and that relief society is an important part of that restoration as evidence of their desire that the glorious heritage of relief society be preserved the first presidency recently published and distributed worldwide daughters in my kingdom the history and work of relief society within the pages of this book we can find patterns and examples of sisters and brothers working in partnership in families and the church and we can learn principles about who we are what we believe and what we should protect we have been encouraged by the first presidency to study this important book and allow its timeless truths and inspiring examples to influence our lives24 as sisters become more aligned with the purposes of relief society the vision of the prophets will be fulfilled president kimball said there is a power in this organization of relief society that has not yet been fully exercised to strengthen the homes of zion and build the kingdom of godnor will it until both the sisters and the priesthood catch the vision of relief society25 he prophesied that much of the major growth that is coming to the church in the last days will come because many of the good women of the world in whom there is often an inner sense of spirituality will be drawn to the church in large numbers this will happen to the degree that the women of the church are seen as distinct and differentin happy waysfrom the women of the world26 i am grateful for the vision of prophets regarding relief society i like president gordon b hinckley am convinced there is no other organization anywhere to match the relief society of this church27 it is our responsibility now to align ourselves with the vision of the prophets regarding relief society as we seek to increase faith strengthen families and provide relief i close with the words of president lorenzo snow the future of the relief society is full of promise as the church grows its field of usefulness will be correspondingly enlarged and it will be even more potent for good than it has been in the past28 to sisters who help advance the kingdom of god he said as you have shared in these labors so you will most certainly share in the triumph of the work and in the exaltation and glory which the lord will give to his faithful children29 of this vision i also bear testimony in the name of jesus christ amen notes see julie b beck fulfilling the purpose of relief society liahona and ensign nov 2008 10811 see julie b
