that the lost may be found by elder m russell ballard of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder m russell ballard as you seek to live the gospel and doctrine of christ the holy ghost will guide you and your family brothers and sisters according to the scriptures the liahona was a round ball of curious workmanship featuring two spindles one of which pointed the way father lehis family should go into the wilderness 1 nephi 1610 i think i know why lehi was greatly astonished when he first saw it because i remember my reaction when i first saw and witnessed a gps unit in my mind it was a modernday device of curious workmanship somehow in some way i cant even imagine this little device right in my phone can pinpoint exactly where i am and tell me exactly how to get where i want to go for both my wife barbara and me the gps is a blessing for barbara it means she doesnt have to tell me to stop and ask for directions and for me it means i can be right when i say i dont need to ask anyone i know exactly where im going now brothers and sisters we have available to us a tool even more remarkable than the best gps everyone loses his or her way at some point to some degree it is through the promptings of the holy ghost that we can be brought safely back onto the right path and it is the atoning sacrifice of the savior that can return us home being lost can apply to whole societies as well as to individuals today we live in a time when much of this world has lost its way particularly with regard to values and priorities within our homes one hundred years ago president joseph f smith connected happiness directly to the family and admonished us to focus our efforts there he said there can be no genuine happiness separate and apart from the home there is no happiness without service and there is no service greater than that which converts the home into a divine institution and which promotes and preserves family life the home is what needs reforming teachings of presidents of the church joseph f smith 1998 382 384 it is our homes and families that need reforming in this increasingly materialistic and secular world a stunning example is the growing disregard for marriage here in the united states earlier this year the new york times reported that the share of children born to unmarried women has crossed a threshold more than half of births to american women under 30 occur outside marriage jason deparle and sabrina tavernise unwed mothers now a majority before age of 30 new york times feb 18 2012 a1 we also know that among couples in the united states who do marry nearly half get divorced even those who stay married often lose their way by letting other things interfere with their family relationships equally worrisome is the evergrowing gap between the rich and poor and between those who strive to preserve family values and commitments and those who have given up on doing so statistically those who have less education and consequently lower incomes are less likely to marry and to go to church and much more likely to be involved in crime and to have children outside of marriage and these trends are also troubling in much of the rest of the world see w bradford wilcox and others no money no honey no church the deinstitutionalization of religious life among the white working class available at wwwvirginiaedumarriageprojectpdfsreligion_workingpaperpdf opposite of what many had thought prosperity and education seem to be connected to a higher likelihood of having traditional families and values the real question of course is about cause and effect do some sectors of our society have stronger values and families because they are more educated and prosperous or are they more educated and prosperous because they have values and strong families in this worldwide church we know that it is the latter when people make family and religious commitments to gospel principles they begin to do better spiritually and often temporally as well and of course societies at large are strengthened as families grow stronger commitments to family and values are the basic cause nearly everything else is effect when couples marry and make commitments to each other they greatly increase their chances of economic wellbeing when children are born in wedlock and have both a mom and a dad their opportunities and their likelihood of occupational success skyrocket and when families work and play together neighborhoods and communities flourish economies improve and less government and fewer costly safety nets are required so the bad news is that family breakdown is causing a host of societal and economic ills but the good news is that like any cause and effect those ills can be reversed if what is causing them is changed inequities are resolved by living correct principles and values brothers and sisters the most important cause of our lifetime is our families if we will devote ourselves to this cause we will improve every other aspect of our lives and will become as a people and as a church an example and a beacon for all peoples of the earth but this is not easy in a world where hearts are turning in many directions and where the whole planet seems to be constantly moving and changing at a pace never before imagined nothing stays the same for long styles trends fads political correctness and even perceptions of right and wrong shift and move as the prophet isaiah predicted wrong is portrayed as right and right as wrong see isaiah 520 the spiritual divide gets even wider as evil becomes ever more deceptive and subtle and pulls people toward it like a dark magneteven as the gospel of truth and light attracts the honest in heart and the honorable of the earth who seek what is moral and good we may be relatively small in number but as members of this church we can reach across these widening gaps we know the power of christcentered service that brings together gods children regardless of their spiritual or their economic status one year ago the first presidency invited us to participate in a day of service celebrating 75 years of the welfare program which helps people to become more selfsufficient millions of hours were contributed by our members all around the world the church is a mooring in this tempestuous sea an anchor in the churning waters of change and division and a beacon to those who value and seek righteousness the lord uses this church as a tool in pulling his children throughout the world toward the protection of his gospel the spirit of elijah which has no boundaries is also a great power in the lords purposes for the eternal destiny of his children in malachis words the spirit of the holy ghost turns the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers malachi 46 the church stands as an example of heart turning and as a catalyst for good in the world among church members who are married in the temple and who regularly attend sunday meetings the divorce rate is significantly less than that of the world and families remain closer and are in more frequent communication the health in our families is better and we live several years longer than the population average we contribute more financial resources and more service per capita to those in need and we are more likely to seek higher education i point out these things not to boast but to testify that life is better and much happier as hearts turn toward family and as families live in the light of the gospel of christ so what can we do to not become lost first may i suggest that we prioritize put everything you do outside the home in subjection to and in support of what happens inside your home remember president harold b lees counsel that the most important work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes teachings of presidents of the church harold b lee 2000 134 and president david o mckays timeless no other success can compensate for failure in the home quoted from j e mcculloch home the savior of civilization 1924 42 in conference report apr 1935 116 organize your personal lives to provide time for prayer and scriptures and family activity give your children responsibilities in the home that will teach them how to work teach them that living the gospel will lead them away from the filth promiscuity and violence of the internet media and video games they will not be lost and they will be prepared to handle responsibility when it is thrust upon them second we need to do things in the right order marriage first and then family too many in the world have forgotten this natural order of things and think they can change it or even reverse it remove any of your fear with faith trust the power of god to guide you to you who are not yet married pay careful attention to finding your eternal companion young men remember something else that president joseph f smith said bachelorhood carries to the superficial mind the idea that it is desirable because it brings with it the minimum of responsibility the real fault lies with the young men the license of the age leads them from paths of duty and responsibility their sisters are the victims and would marry if they could and would accept cheerfully the responsibilities of family life gospel doctrine 5th ed 1939 281 and to you young women i would add that you must also not lose sight of this responsibility no career can bring you as much fulfillment as rearing a family and when you are my age you will realize this even more third husbands and wives you should be equal partners in your marriage read often and understand the proclamation on the family and follow it avoid unrighteous dominion in any form no one owns a spouse or children god is the father of us all and has extended to us the privilege of our own family which was previously only his to help us become more like him as his children we should learn at home to love god and to know that we can ask him for the help we need everyone married or single can be happy and supportive within whatever family you may have and finally use the family resources of the church in raising children families can draw upon the help of the ward support and work in tandem with priesthood and auxiliary leaders and take full advantage of the churchs youth and family programs remember another of president lees insightful phrasesthat the church is the scaffolding with which we build eternal families see teachings harold b lee 148 now if for any reason you individually or as a family have lost your way then you need only apply the saviors teachings from luke chapter 15 to correct your course here the savior tells of the effort of a shepherd searching for his lost sheep of a woman searching for a lost coin and of the welcome received by the prodigal son returning home why did jesus teach these parables he wanted us to know that none of us will ever be so lost that we cannot find our way again through his atonement and his teachings as you seek to live the gospel and doctrine of christ the holy ghost will guide you and your family you will have a spiritual gps to tell you always where you are and where you are going i bear witness that the resurrected redeemer of mankind loves all of us and he has promised if we will follow him he will lead us safely back into the presence of our heavenly father of which i testify in the name of jesus christ amen
