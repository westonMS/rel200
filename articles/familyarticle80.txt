in tune with the music of faith by elder quentin l cook of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder quentin l cook god loves all his children he wants all of them to return to him he desires everyone to be in tune with the sacred music of faith as the general authorities of the church meet with members all over the world we see firsthand how latterday saints are a force for good we commend you for all you do to bless the lives of all people those of us with public affairs assignments are acutely aware that many opinion leaders and journalists in the united states and around the world have increased their public discussion of the church and its members a unique confluence of factors has raised the churchs profile significantly1 many who write about the church have made a sincere effort to understand our people and our doctrine they have been civil and have tried to be objective for which we are grateful we also recognize that many individuals are not in tune with sacred things chief rabbi lord sacks of england speaking to roman catholic leaders last december at the pontifical gregorian university noted how secular some parts of the world have become he stated that one culprit is an aggressive scientific atheism tone deaf to the music of faith2 the great introductory vision in the book of mormon is lehis prophetic dream of the tree of life3 this vision starkly describes the challenges to faith that exist in our day and the great divide between those who love worship and feel accountable to god and those who do not lehi explains some of the conduct that destroys faith some are proud vain and foolish they are interested only in the socalled wisdom of the world4 others have some interest in god but are lost in worldly mists of darkness and sin5 some have tasted of the love of god and his word but feel ashamed because of those mocking them and fall away into forbidden paths6 finally there are those who are in tune with the music of faith you know who you are you love the lord and his gospel and continuously try to live and share his message especially with your families7 you are in harmony with the promptings of the spirit have awakened to the power of gods word have religious observance in your homes and diligently try to live christlike lives as his disciples we recognize how busy you are without a paid professional ministry the responsibility for administering the church depends on you consecrated members we know it is common for members of bishoprics and stake presidencies and many others to render long hours of devoted service auxiliary and quorum presidencies are exemplary in their selfless sacrifice this service and sacrifice extend through the entire membership to those keeping clerical records faithful home and visiting teachers and those teaching classes we are grateful to those who courageously serve as scoutmasters and nursery leaders as well you all have our love and appreciation for what you do and who you are we acknowledge that there are members who are less interested in and less faithful to some of the saviors teachings our desire is for these members to awaken fully to faith and increase their activity and commitment god loves all his children he wants all of them to return to him he desires everyone to be in tune with the sacred music of faith the saviors atonement is a gift for everyone it needs to be taught and understood that we love and respect all of the people whom lehi described8 remember it is not up to us to judge judgment is the lords9 president thomas s monson has specifically asked us to have the courage to refrain from judging others10 he has also asked every faithful member to rescue those who have tasted of the gospel fruit and then have fallen away as well as those who have not yet found the strait and narrow path we pray that they will hold to the rod and partake of the love of god which will fill their souls with exceedingly great joy11 while lehis vision includes all people the culminating doctrinal concept is the eternal significance of the family the family is ordained of god it is the most important unit in time and in eternity12 as lehi partook of the fruit of the tree of life the love of god he was desirous that his family should partake of it also13 our great desire is to raise our children in truth and righteousness one principle that will help us accomplish this is to avoid being overly judgmental about conduct that is foolish or unwise but not sinful many years ago when my wife and i had children at home elder dallin h oaks taught that it was important to distinguish between youthful mistakes which should be corrected and sins that require chastening and repentance14 where there is lack of wisdom our children need instruction where there is sin repentance is essential15 we found this to be helpful in our own family religious observance in the home blesses our families example is particularly important what we are speaks so loudly that our children may not hear what we say when i was nearly five years old my mother received word that her younger brother had been killed when the battleship on which he was serving was bombed off the coast of japan near the end of world war ii16 this news was devastating to her she was very emotional and went into the bedroom after a while i peeked into the room to see if she was ok she was kneeling by the bed in prayer a great peace came over me because she had taught me to pray and love the savior this was typical of the example she always set for me mothers and fathers praying with children may be more important than any other example the message ministry and atonement of jesus christ our savior are our essential family curriculum no scripture characterizes our faith better than 2 nephi 2526 and we talk of christ we rejoice in christ we preach of christ we prophesy of christ and we write according to our prophecies that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins one of the underlying premises of lehis vision is that faithful members must hold fast to the rod of iron to keep them on the strait and narrow path leading to the tree of life it is essential for members to read ponder and study the scriptures17 the book of mormon is of seminal importance18 there will of course always be those who underestimate the significance of or even disparage this sacred book some have used humor before i served a mission a university professor quoted mark twains statement that if you took and it came to pass out of the book of mormon it would have been only a pamphlet19 a few months later while i was serving a mission in london england a distinguished oxfordeducated teacher at london university an egyptian expert in semitic languages read the book of mormon corresponded with president david o mckay and met with missionaries he informed them he was convinced the book of mormon was indeed a translation of the learning of the jews and the language of the egyptians for the periods described in the book of mormon20 one example among many he used was the conjunctive phrase and it came to pass which he said mirrored how he would translate phraseology used in ancient semitic writings21 the professor was informed that while his intellectual approach based on his profession had helped him it was still essential to have a spiritual testimony through study and prayer he gained a spiritual witness and was baptized so what one famous humorist saw as an object of ridicule a scholar recognized as profound evidence of the truth of the book of mormon which was confirmed to him by the spirit the essential doctrine of agency requires that a testimony of the restored gospel be based on faith rather than just external or scientific proof obsessive focus on things not yet fully revealed such as how the virgin birth or the resurrection of the savior could have occurred or exactly how joseph smith translated our scriptures will not be efficacious or yield spiritual progress these are matters of faith ultimately moronis counsel to read and ponder and then ask god in all sincerity of heart with real intent to confirm scriptural truths by the witness of the spirit is the answer22 in addition when we inculcate into our lives scriptural imperatives and live the gospel we are blessed with the spirit and taste of his goodness with feelings of joy happiness and especially peace23 clearly a dividing line between those who hear the music of faith and those who are tonedeaf or offkey is the active study of the scriptures i was deeply touched years ago that a beloved prophet spencer w kimball emphasized the need to continually read and study the scriptures he said i find that when i get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking that i am far far away if i immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns24 i hope we are reading the book of mormon with our children regularly i have discussed this with my own children they have shared with me two observations first persistence in reading the scriptures daily as a family is the key my daughter in a lighthearted way describes their earlymorning efforts with mostly teenage children to consistently read the scriptures she and her husband wake up early in the morning and move through the blurry mist to grasp the iron railing that lines their staircase to where their family gathers to read the word of god persistence is the answer and a sense of humor helps it requires great effort from every family member every day but it is worth the effort temporary setbacks are overshadowed by persistence the second is how our youngest son and his wife are reading the scriptures with their young family two out of their four children are not old enough to read for the fiveyearold they have five finger signals to which he responds in order for him to participate fully in the family scripture reading the signal for finger 1 is for him to repeat and it came to pass whenever it appears in the book of mormon i have to admit that i love the fact that the phrase appears so often incidentally for the interest of young families finger signal 2 is and thus we see fingers 3 4 and 5 are chosen by the parents based on the words contained in the chapter they are reading we know that family scripture study and family home evenings are not always perfect regardless of the challenges you face do not become discouraged please understand that having faith in the lord jesus christ and keeping his commandments are and always will be the defining test of mortality above all else each of us must realize that when one is tonedeaf to the music of faith he or she is out of tune with the spirit as the prophet nephi taught ye have heard his voice and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice but ye were past feeling that ye could not feel his words25 our doctrine is clear we are to be positive and of good cheer we emphasize our faith not our fears we rejoice in the lords assurance that he will stand by us and give us guidance and direction26 the holy ghost testifies to our hearts that we have a loving father in heaven whose merciful plan for our redemption will be fulfilled in every aspect because of the atoning sacrifice of jesus christ as naomi w randall author of i am a child of god penned his spirit guides his love assures that fear departs when faith endures27 let us therefore wherever we are on the path of discipleship in lehis vision resolve to awaken within us and our families a greater desire to claim the saviors incomprehensible gift of eternal life i pray that we will stay in tune with the music of faith i testify of the divinity of jesus christ and the reality of his atonement in the name of jesus christ amen notes see doctrine and covenants 130
