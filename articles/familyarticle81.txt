he truly loves us by elder paul e koelliker of the seventy imageelder paul e koelliker because of the heavendesigned pattern of the family we more fully understand how our heavenly father truly loves each of us equally and fully i love being with the fulltime missionaries they are full of faith hope and genuine charity their missionary experience is like a minilife packaged in 18 to 24 months they arrive as spiritual infants with a serious appetite to learn and they leave as mature adults seemingly ready to conquer any and all challenges placed before them i also love the devoted senior missionaries who are full of patience wisdom and calm assurance they bring a gift of stability and love to the youthful energy that surrounds them together the young missionaries and the senior couples are a powerful persevering force for good which is having a profound effect on their lives and upon those who are touched by their service recently i listened to two of these great young missionaries as they reviewed their experiences and efforts in that reflective moment they considered the individuals they had contacted that day some of whom were more responsive than others as they considered the circumstances they asked how can we help each individual develop a desire to know more about heavenly father how do we help them feel his spirit how can we help them know that we love them in my minds eye i could see these two young men three or four years after completing their missions i visualized them as having found their eternal companions and serving in an elders quorum or teaching a group of young men now instead of thinking about their investigators they were asking the same questions about their quorum members or the young men they were commissioned to nurture i saw how their missionary experience could be applied as a template for nurturing others throughout the rest of their lives as this army of righteous disciples return from their missions to the many countries across the earth they are becoming key contributors in the work of establishing the church the book of mormon prophet lehi might have been pondering the same set of questions as these missionaries when he listened to the response of his sons to the direction and vision he had been given and thus laman and lemuel being the eldest did murmur against their father and they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that god who had created them 1 nephi 212 perhaps we have each felt the frustration lehi experienced with his two eldest sons as we face a drifting child an uncommitted investigator or an unresponsive prospective elder our hearts swell as lehis did and we ask how can i help them feel and listen to the spirit so they are not caught up in worldly distractions two scriptures stand out in my mind that can help us find our way through these distractions and feel the power of gods love nephi gives a key to the door of learning through his own personal experience i nephi having great desires to know of the mysteries of god wherefore i did cry unto the lord and behold he did visit me and did soften my heart that i did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father wherefore i did not rebel against him like unto my brothers 1 nephi 216 awakening the desire to know enables our spiritual capacities to hear the voice of heaven finding a way to awaken and nurture that desire is the quest and responsibility of each of usmissionaries parents teachers leaders and members as we feel that desire stirring in our hearts we are prepared to benefit from the learning of the second scripture that i want to mention in june of 1831 as calls were being extended to early church leaders joseph smith was told that satan is abroad in the land and he goeth forth deceiving the nations to combat this distracting influence the lord said that he would give us a pattern in all things that we may not be deceived dc 5214 patterns are templates guides repeating steps or paths one follows to stay aligned with gods purpose if followed they will keep us humble awake and able to discern the voice of the holy spirit from those voices that distract us and lead us away the lord then instructs us he that trembleth under my power shall be made strong and shall bring forth fruits of praise and wisdom according to the revelations and truths which i have given you dc 5217 the blessing of humble prayer offered with real intent allows the holy spirit to touch our hearts and helps us to remember what we knew before we were born into this mortal experience as we clearly understand our heavenly fathers plan for us we begin to acknowledge our responsibility to help others learn and understand his plan closely tied to helping others remember is the way we personally live the gospel and apply it in our lives when we actually live the gospel in the pattern taught by the lord jesus christ our ability to help others increases the following experience is an example of how this principle can work two young missionaries knocked on a door hoping to find someone to receive their message the door opened and a rather large man greeted them in a lessthanfriendly voice i thought i told you not to knock on my door again i warned you before that if you ever came back it would not be a pleasant experience now leave me alone he quickly closed the door as the elders walked away the older more experienced missionary put his arm on the younger missionarys shoulder to comfort and encourage him unknown to them the man watched them through the window to be sure they understood his message he fully expected to see them laugh and make light of his curt response to their attempted visit however as he witnessed the expression of kindness between the two missionaries his heart was instantly softened he reopened the door and asked the missionaries to come back and share their message with him it is when we yield to gods will and live his pattern that his spirit is felt the savior taught by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another john 1335 this principle of having love one to another and developing our ability to be christcentered in how we think speak and act is fundamental in becoming disciples of christ and teachers of his gospel awakening this desire prepares us to look for the promised patterns seeking for the patterns leads us to the doctrine of christ as taught by the savior and his prophetleaders one pattern of this doctrine is to endure to the end and blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my zion at that day for they shall have the gift and the power of the holy ghost and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the lamb 1 nephi 1337 what is the ultimate means by which we can enjoy the gift and power of the holy ghost it is the power that comes by being faithful disciples of jesus christ it is our love for him and our fellowman it is the savior who defined the pattern of love when he taught us a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another john 1334 president gordon b hinckley confirmed this principle when he said to love the lord is not just counsel it is not just wellwishing it is a commandment love of god is the root of all virtue of all goodness of all strength of character of all fidelity to do right words of the living prophet liahona dec 1996 8 excerpts from recent addresses of president gordon b hinckley ensign apr 1996 73 the fathers plan designated the pattern of the family to help us learn apply and understand the power of love on the day my own family was organized my sweet ann and i went to the temple and entered into the covenant of marriage how much i thought i loved her on that day but i had only begun to see the vision of love as each of our children and grandchildren entered into our lives our love has been expanded to love each of them equally and fully there is seemingly no end to the expansive capacity to love the feeling of love from our heavenly father is like a gravitational pull from heaven as we remove the distractions that pull us toward the world and exercise our agency to seek him we open our hearts to a celestial force which draws us toward him nephi described its impact as even unto the consuming of his flesh 2 nephi 421 this same power of love caused alma to sing a song of redeeming love alma 526 see also verse 9 it touched mormon in such a way that he counseled us to pray with all the energy of our heart that we might be filled with his love moroni 748 both modern and ancient scripture are full of reminders of heavenly fathers eternal love for his children i am confident that our heavenly fathers arms are constantly extended ever ready to embrace each one of us and say to each one with that quiet piercing voice i love you because of the heavendesigned pattern of the family we more fully understand how our heavenly father truly loves each of us equally and fully i testify that it is true god does know and love us he has given us a vision of his holy place and called prophets and apostles to teach the principles and the patterns that will bring us back to him as we strive to awaken the desire to know in ourselves and in others and as we live the patterns we discover we will be drawn toward him i testify that jesus is the very son of god our exemplar our beloved redeemer which i express in the name of jesus christ amen
