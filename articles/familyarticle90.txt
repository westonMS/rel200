become as a little child by jean a stevens first counselor in the primary general presidency imagejean a stevens if we have a heart to learn and a willingness to follow the example of children their divine attributes can hold a key to unlocking our own spiritual growth our father in heaven in his great wisdom and love sends his spirit sons and daughters to this earth as children they come to families as precious gifts with a divine nature and destiny our heavenly father knows children are a key to helping us become like him there is so much we can learn from children this important truth was evidenced some years ago as a member of the seventy was on assignment in hong kong he visited a very humble ward that was struggling in many ways unable to provide for its own needs as the bishop described their situation the general authority felt the impression to have the members pay their tithing the bishop knowing their dire circumstances was concerned about how he could carry out that counsel he thought about it and decided he would approach some of the most faithfilled members of his ward and ask them to pay their tithing the next sunday he went to the primary he taught the children about the lords law of tithing and asked if they would be willing to pay tithing on the money they earned the children said they would and they did the bishop later went to the adults in the ward and shared with them that for the past six months their faithful children had been paying tithing he asked them if they would be willing to follow the example of these children and do the same the people were so touched by the sacrifices the children were willing to make that they did what was necessary to pay their tithing and the windows of heaven were opened with the example of these faithful children a ward grew in obedience and in testimony it was jesus christ himself who taught us to look to children as an example the new testament records his answer when his apostles disputed who should be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven jesus answered their question with a small yet powerful object lesson he called a little child to him and set him in the midst of them and said except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven matthew 1834 what is it we should learn from children what qualities do they possess and what examples do they demonstrate that can help us in our own spiritual development these precious children of god come to us with believing hearts they are full of faith and receptive to feelings of the spirit they exemplify humility obedience and love they are often the first to love and the first to forgive let me share some experiences of how children can bless our lives with their innocent yet powerful examples of christlike attributes todd a little boy just two years old recently went with his mother to an art museum that was showing a special exhibit of beautiful paintings of the savior as they walked past these sacred images she heard her little boy reverently saying the name jesus she looked down to see him folding his arms and bowing his head as he viewed the paintings could we learn from todd something about an attitude of humility of reverence and of love for the lord last fall i watched the example of a 10yearold boy in armenia as we waited for sacrament meeting to begin he noticed the oldest member of the branch arrive he was the one who quickly went to her side offering his arm to steady her faltering steps he assisted her to the front row of the chapel where she could hear could his small act of kindness teach us that those who are greatest in the lords kingdom are those who look for opportunities to serve others katie a primaryage girl taught us as we saw her influence on her family she attended primary and was drawn to the teachings of the gospel with growing faith and testimony katie left a note on her parents pillow she wrote that the gospel truths had found a home in her heart she shared her longing to be close to her heavenly father to be obedient to his commandments and to have their family sealed in the temple the simple testimony of their sweet daughter touched her parents hearts in a powerful way katie and her family did receive sacred temple ordinances that bound their family together forever katies believing heart and example of faith helped bring eternal blessings to her family could her sincere testimony and desire to follow the lords plan lead us to see more clearly what really matters most our family is learning from a close relative sixyearold liam this past year he has battled aggressive brain cancer after two difficult surgeries it was decided that radiation would also be necessary during these radiation treatments he was required to be all alone and lie absolutely still liam did not want to be sedated because he disliked the way it made him feel he was determined that if he could just hear his dads voice over the intercom he could lie still without the sedative during these anxious times his dad spoke to him with words of encouragement and love liam although you cant see me i am right here i know you can do it i love you liam successfully accomplished the 33 required radiation treatments while holding perfectly still a feat his doctors thought would be impossible without sedation for one so young through months of pain and difficulty liams contagious optimism has been a powerful example of meeting adversity with hope and even happiness his doctors nurses and countless others have been inspired by his courage we are all learning important lessons from liamlessons about choosing faith and trusting in the lord just like liam we cannot see our heavenly father but we can listen for his voice to give us the strength we need to endure the challenges of life could liams example help us to better understand king benjamins words to become as a childsubmissive meek humble patient and full of love see mosiah 319 these children are providing examples of some of the childlike qualities we need to develop or rediscover in ourselves in order to enter into the kingdom of heaven they are bright spirits who are untarnished by the worldteachable and full of faith it is no wonder the savior has a special love and appreciation for little children among the transcendent events of the saviors visit to the americas his tender ministry to the children stands apart in a poignant way he reached out to each child and he took their little children one by one and blessed them and prayed unto the father for them and when he had done this he wept and he spake unto the multitude and said unto them behold your little ones 3 nephi 172123 elder m russell ballard has taught us the importance of the saviors admonition to behold your little ones when he said notice that he didnt say glance at them or casually observe them or occasionally take a look in their general direction he said to behold them to me that means that we should embrace them with our eyes and with our hearts we should see and appreciate them for who they really are spirit children of our heavenly father with divine attributes behold your little ones tambuli oct 1994 40 emphasis added great shall be the peace of thy children ensign apr 1994 59 there is not a more perfect place to behold our little ones than in our families home is a place where we can all learn and grow together one of
