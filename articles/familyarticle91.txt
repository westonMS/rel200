blessings in each generation of our forever families dear brothers and sisters when our son was in the provo missionary training center sister gong mailed freshbaked bread to him and his missionary companions here are some of the missionary thankyou notes sister gong received sister gong that bread was a taste of home sister gong all i can say is wow that bread is the best thing to enter my mouth since my mothers enchiladas but this is my favorite sister gong the bread was wonderful he then jokingly continued keep me in mind if things dont work out between you and mr gong we love our missionarieseach elder sister and senior couple we are eternally grateful to that special missionary who first brought the restored gospel of jesus christ to our family i gratefully testify that an eternal perspective of gospel conversion and temple covenants can help us see rich blessings in each generation of our forever families the first convert in our gong family to the church of jesus christ of latterday saints is our mother jean gong as a teenager in honolulu hawaii she listened she knew she was baptized and confirmed she is continuing in faith faithful church members helped my mother so that she had gospel friends church callings and continued nourishment by gods good word in todays parlance each new convert young single adult those returning to church activity and others bless generations when they become fellow saints in the household of god1 one family who nurtured my mother was that of gerrit de jong jr a linguist who loved the language of the heart and spirit grandpa de jong tickled my little boy imagination by sayings like blackberries when red are green today speaking of electronic handheld devices i tell young friends blackberries read in church make green bishops blue my parents walter and jean gong were married three times a chinese ceremony for family an american ceremony for friends and a sacred ceremony in the house of the lord for time and eternity our primary children sing i love to see the temple im going there someday2 our youth pledge to receive the ordinances of the temple3 i recently stood in a house of the lord with a worthy couple there to receive blessings by covenant i invited them to make their first honeymoon last 50 years then after 50 years to begin their second honeymoon i found myself looking with this beautiful couple into the temple mirrorsone mirror on this side one mirror on that side together the temple mirrors reflect back and forth images that stretch seemingly into eternity temple mirrors of eternity remind us that each human being has divine nature and destiny that sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of god and for families to be united eternally4 and that growing together in love and faithfulness we can give children roots and wings in temple mirrors of eternity i reflected on first dragon gong born ad 837 late tang dynasty in southern china and the succeeding gong family generations to my father our familys 32nd recorded generation my brother sister and i are in our familys 33rd generation my sons and their cousins the 34th generation our grandson the 35th recorded gong family generation in temple mirrors of eternity i could not see a beginning or end of generations i then imagined not only a succession of generations but also a succession of family relationships in one direction i saw myself as son grandson greatgrandson back to first dragon gong in the mirrors in the other direction i saw myself as father grandfather greatgrandfather i could see my wife susan as daughter granddaughter greatgranddaughter and in the other direction as mother grandmother greatgrandmother in temple mirrors of eternity i began to understand my wife and myself as children of our parents and parents to our children as grandchildren of our grandparents and grandparents to our grandchildren mortalitys great lessons distill upon our souls as we learn and teach in eternal roles including child and parent parent and child scripture describes our savior as the father and the son5 having dwelt in flesh and subjected the flesh to the will of the father our savior knows how to succor us his people in our pains afflictions temptations sicknesses even death6 having descended below all things7 our savior can bear our griefs and carry our sorrows he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities with our saviors stripes we are healed8 from the councils in heaven our savior sought only to do his fathers will this pattern of father and son can help explain the paradox he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it9 the world pursues enlightened selfinterest yet the power is not in us to save ourselves but it is in him infinite and eternal10 only our saviors atonement transcends time and space to swallow up death anger bitterness unfairness loneliness and heartbreak sometimes things go wrong even though we have done our very best a lamb innocent and pure our savior weeps with and for us when we always remember him11 he can stand with us at all times and in all things and in all places that we may be in12 his faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death13 in drawing us to him our savior also draws us to our father in heaven while some things are imperfect on earth we can trust our heavenly father to complete redemptions grand design where justice love and mercy meet in harmony divine14 a miracle of the images we discern in temple mirrors of eternity is that theywecan change when jean and walter gong entered the new and everlasting covenant they opened the way for ancestors such as first dragon gong to be sealed and for posterity to be born in the covenant please remember as we reach out to each sister or brother we bless generations the world is in commotion15 but in his only true and living church16 there is faith and no fear in the words of the apostle paul i also solemnly testify for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord17 i humbly witness god lives he shall wipe away all tears from our eyes18except the tears of joy when we see through temple mirrors of eternity and find ourselves home pure and clean our family
