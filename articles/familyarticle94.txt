courageous parenting by elder larry r lawrence of the seventy imageelder larry r lawrence what the world really needs is courageous parenting from mothers and fathers who are not afraid to speak up and take a stand i would like to speak today to the parents of teenagers your bright and energetic youth are the future of the church and for that reason they are a prime target of the adversary many of you faithful mothers and fathers are listening to conference today praying for answers to help you guide your children through these important years my oldest grandchildren have recently become teens so the subject is near to my heart there are no perfect parents and no easy answers but there are principles of truth that we can rely on the young men and young women mutual theme for 2010 was taken from the book of joshua it begins be strong and of a good courage be not afraid joshua 19 this phrase from the scriptures would be a good theme for parents as well in these last days what the world really needs is courageous parenting from mothers and fathers who are not afraid to speak up and take a stand imagine for a moment that your daughter was sitting on the railroad tracks and you heard the train whistle blowing would you warn her to get off the tracks or would you hesitate worried that she might think you were being overprotective if she ignored your warning would you quickly move her to a safe place of course you would your love for your daughter would override all other considerations you would value her life more than her temporary goodwill challenges and temptations are coming at our teenagers with the speed and power of a freight train as we are reminded in the family proclamation parents are responsible for the protection of their children1 that means spiritually as well as physically in the book of mormon we read about alma the younger counseling his wayward son corianton had made some serious mistakes while serving a mission among the zoramites alma loved him enough to speak very directly to the problem he expressed his deep disappointment that his son had been immoral and explained to him the serious consequences of sin i am inspired every time i read these courageous words from alma and now the spirit of the lord doth say unto me command thy children to do good therefore i command you my son in the fear of god that ye refrain from your iniquities alma 3912 this early intervention by his father became a turning point for corianton he repented and served faithfully thereafter see alma 4231 4312 contrast almas example with that of another father from the scriptures eli in the old testament eli served as the high priest in israel during the childhood of samuel the prophet the scriptures explain that the lord rebuked him severely because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not 1 samuel 313 elis sons never did repent and all of israel suffered because of their folly the story of eli teaches us that parents who love their children cannot afford to be intimidated by them several years ago at general conference elder joe j christensen reminded us that parenting is not a popularity contest2 in the same spirit elder robert d hales has observed sometimes we are afraid of our childrenafraid to counsel with them for fear of offending them3 years ago our 17yearold son wanted to go on a weekend trip with his friends who were all good boys he asked for permission to go i wanted to say yes but for some reason i felt uncomfortable about the trip i shared my feelings with my wife who was very supportive we need to listen to that warning voice she said of course our son was disappointed and asked why we didnt want him to go i answered honestly that i didnt know why i just dont feel good about it i explained and i love you too much to ignore these feelings inside i was quite surprised when he said thats ok dad i understand young people understand more than we realize because they too have the gift of the holy ghost they are trying to recognize the spirit when he speaks and they are watching our example from us they learn to pay attention to their promptingsthat if they dont feel good about something its best not to pursue it its so important for husbands and wives to be united when making parenting decisions if either parent doesnt feel good about something then permission should not be granted if either feels uncomfortable about a movie a television show a video game a party a dress a swimsuit or an internet activity have the courage to support each other and say no i would like to share with you a letter from a heartbroken mother her teenage son gradually lost the spirit and drifted away from church activity she explained how this happened all throughout my sons teenage years i worried and tried to stop him from playing violent video games i talked to my husband and showed him articles in the ensign and in the newspaper that cautioned about these games but my husband felt it was ok he said that our son wasnt out using drugs and that i should stop worrying there were times that i would hide the controllers and my husband would give them back it began to be easier for me to give in than to fight it i really feel that gaming is just as addictive as drugs i would do anything to prevent other parents from going through this experience brothers and sisters if your spouse doesnt feel good about something show respect for those feelings when you take the easy way out by saying and doing nothing you may be enabling destructive behavior parents can prevent a lot of heartache by teaching their children to postpone romantic relationships until the time comes when they are ready for marriage prematurely pairing off with a boyfriend or girlfriend is dangerous becoming a couple creates emotional intimacy which too often leads to physical intimacy satan knows this sequence and uses it to his advantage he will do whatever he can to keep young men from serving missions and to prevent temple marriages it is vital that parents have the courage to speak up and intervene before satan succeeds president boyd k packer has taught that when morality is involved we have both the right and the obligation to raise a warning voice4 i have always believed that nothing really good happens late at night and that young people need to know what time they are expected to come home there is a great deal of wisdom displayed when parents stay up and wait for their children to return home young men and women make far better choices when they know their parents are waiting up to hear about their evening and to kiss them good night may i express my personal warning about a practice that is common in many cultures i am referring to sleepovers or spending the night at the home of a friend as a bishop i discovered that too many youth violated the word of wisdom or the law of chastity for the first time as part of a sleepover too often their first exposure to pornography and even their first encounter with the police occurred when they were spending the night away from home peer pressure becomes more powerful when our children are away from our influence and when their defenses are weakened late at night if you have ever felt uneasy about an overnight activity dont be afraid to respond to that warning voice inside always be prayerful when it comes to protecting your precious children courageous parenting does not always involve saying no parents also need courage to say yes to the counsel of modernday prophets our church leaders have counseled us to establish righteous patterns in our homes consider five fundamental practices that have the power to fortify our youth family prayer family scripture study family home evening family dinner together and regular oneonone interviews with each child it takes courage to gather children from whatever theyre doing and kneel together as a family it takes courage to turn off the television and the computer and to guide your family through the pages of the scriptures every day it takes courage to turn down other invitations on monday night so that you can reserve that evening for your family it takes courage and willpower to avoid overscheduling so that your family can be home for dinner one of the most effective ways we can influence our sons and daughters is to counsel with them in private interviews by listening closely we can discover the desires of their hearts help them set righteous goals and also share with them the spiritual impressions that we have received about them counseling requires courage try to imagine what the rising generation could become if these five righteous patterns were practiced consistently in every home our young people could be like helamans army invincible see alma 572526 parenting teenagers in the latter days is a very humbling assignment satan and his followers are striving to bring this generation down the lord is counting on valiant parents to bring them up parents be strong and of a good courage be not afraid joshua 19 i know that god hears and will answer your prayers i testify that the lord supports and blesses courageous
