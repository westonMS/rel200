the power of the priesthood by president boyd k packer president of the quorum of the twelve apostles imagepresident boyd k packer the priesthood does not have the strength that it should have and will not have until the power of the priesthood is firmly fixed in the families i speak to the fathers of the families and to families everywhere in the church years ago we began correlation under the direction of president harold b lee at that time president thomas s monson said today we are encamped against the greatest array of sin vice and evil ever assembled before our eyes the battle plan whereby we fight to save the souls of men is not our own it came through the inspiration and revelation of the lord1 during those years of correlation the whole operating face of the church was changed the entire curriculum was restructured the objectives and relationships of the organizations one to another were redefined the key word during those years of correlation and restructuring was priesthood president monson also spoke of gideon a hero in the old testament gideon was chosen to lead the armies of israel thousands strong but of them all he chose only 300 men gideon had an interesting way of selecting his recruits when the men drank water at a stream most bowed down to drink those he passed over a few scooped up water in their hands and drank remaining completely alert they were the ones chosen2 we live in a day of wars and rumors of wars and earthquakes in divers places3 as prophesied the whole earth is in commotion4 and satan is abroad in the land5 he seeks to destroy all that is good and righteous6 he is lucifer who was cast out of the presence of god7 against all of that we have very positive feelings about what lies ahead gideons small force succeeded because as the record states they stood every man in his place8 this dispensation of the fulness of times9 opened with the appearance of the father and the son to the boy joseph smith10 next the angel moroni showed joseph where the plates containing the book of mormon had been buried11 joseph was given power to translate them12 during translation joseph and oliver cowdery read about baptism they prayed to know what to do13 there appeared to them an angelic messenger john the baptist he conferred upon them the aaronic priesthood which holds the keys of the ministering of angels and of the gospel of repentance and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins14 the apostles peter james and john who were closest to the lord in his ministry appeared next and conferred upon joseph and oliver the higher priesthood15 or the holy priesthood after the order of the son of god16 the priesthood the scriptures direct was to be named after melchizedek the great high priest to whom abraham paid tithes17 this then became their authority through the keys of the priesthood they had access to all of the powers of heaven they were commanded to carry the gospel unto all nations18 it has never been easy to live the gospel of jesus christ it was not easy when he lived and it was not easy in the early days of the church the early saints were subjected to unspeakable suffering and opposition it has been over 180 years since the priesthood was restored we now number nearly 14 million members even so we are a tiny fraction when compared to the billions of people on earth but we are who we are and we know what we know and we are to go forth and preach the gospel the book of mormon makes it clear that we never will dominate by numbers but we have the power of the priesthood19 the prophet nephi wrote it came to pass that i beheld the church of the lamb of god and its numbers were few nevertheless i beheld that the church of the lamb who were the saints of god were also upon all the face of the earth and their dominions upon the face of the earth were small20 president joseph fielding smith said while it may be said that we are but a handful in comparison with the world yet we may be compared with the leaven of which the savior spoke which will eventually leaven or lift the whole world21 we can and in due time certainly will influence all of humanity it will be known who we are and why we are it might seem hopeless it is monumentally difficult but it is not only possible but certain that we will win the battle against satan some years ago i gave a talk entitled what every elder should know a primer on principles of priesthood government later when it was to be published i changed the title to read what every elder should knowand every sister as well22 i include the sisters because it is crucial for everyone to understand what is expected of the brethren unless we enlist the attention of the mothers and daughters and sisterswho have influence on their husbands fathers sons and brotherswe cannot progress the priesthood will lose great power if the sisters are neglected priesthood is the authority and the power which god has granted to men on earth to act for him23 when priesthood authority is exercised properly priesthood bearers do what he would do if he were present we have done very well at distributing the authority of the priesthood we have priesthood authority planted nearly everywhere we have quorums of elders and high priests worldwide but distributing the authority of the priesthood has raced i think ahead of distributing the power of the priesthood the priesthood does not have the strength that it should have and will not have until the power of the priesthood is firmly fixed in the families as it should be president harold b lee stated it seems clear to me that the church has no choiceand never has hadbut to do more to assist the family in carrying out its divine mission not only because that is the order of heaven but also because that is the most practical contribution we can make to our youthto help improve the quality of life in the latterday saint homes as important as our many programs and organizational efforts are these should not supplant the home they should support the home24 president joseph f smith made this statement about the priesthood in the home in the home the presiding authority is always vested in the father and in all home affairs and family matters there is no other authority paramount to illustrate this principle a single incident will perhaps suffice it sometimes happens that the elders are called in to administer to the members of a family among these elders there may be presidents of stakes apostles or even members of the first presidency of the church it is not proper under these circumstances for the father to stand back and expect the elders to direct the administration of this important ordinance the father is there it is his right and it is his duty to preside he should select the one who is to administer the oil and the one who is to be mouth in prayer and he should not feel that because there are present presiding authorities in the church that he is therefore divested of his rights to direct the administration of that blessing of the gospel in his home if the father be absent the mother should request the presiding authority present to take charge the father presides at the table at prayer and gives general directions relating to his family life whoever may be present25 during the vietnam war we held a series of special meetings for members of the church called into military service after such a meeting in chicago i was standing next to president harold b lee when a fine young latterday saint told president lee that he was on leave to visit his home and then had orders to vietnam he asked president lee to give him a blessing much to my surprise president lee said your father should give you the blessing very disappointed the boy said my father wouldnt know how to give a blessing president lee answered go home my boy and tell your father that you are going away to war and want to receive a fathers blessing from him if he does not know how tell him that you will sit on a chair he can stand behind you and put his hands on your head and say whatever comes this young soldier went away sorrowing about two years later i met him again i do not recall where he reminded me of that experience and said i did as i was told to do i explained to my father that i would sit on the chair and that he should put his hands on my head the power of the priesthood filled both of us that was a strength and protection in those perilous months of battle another time i was in a distant city after a conference we were ordaining and setting apart leaders as we concluded the stake president asked can we ordain a young man to be an elder who is leaving for the mission field the answer of course was yes as the young man came forward he motioned for three brethren to follow and stand in for his ordination i noticed on the back row a carbon copy of this boy and i asked is that your father the young man said yes i said your father will ordain you and he protested but ive already asked another brother to ordain me and i said young man your father will ordain you and youll live to thank the lord for this day then the father came forward thank goodness he was an elder had he not been he soon could have been in the military they would call that a battlefield commission sometimes such things are done in the church the father did not know how to ordain his son i put my arm around him and coached him through the ordinance when he was finished the young man was an elder then something wonderful happened completely changed the father and son embraced it was obvious that had never happened before the father through his tears said i didnt get to ordain my other boys think how much more was accomplished than if another had ordained him even an apostle while the priesthood is presently all over the world we call on every elder and high priest every holder of the priesthood to stand like gideons small but powerful force of 300 in his own place we now must awaken in every elder and high priest in every quorum and group and in the father of every home the power of the priesthood of the almighty the lord said that the weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones26 the prophet nephi also told of the power of the lamb of god that it descended upon the saints of the church of the lamb and upon the covenant people of the lord who were scattered upon all the face of the earth and said that they were armed with righteousness and with the power of god in great glory27 we need everyone the tired or worn out or lazy and even those who are bound down with guilt must be restored through repentance and forgiveness too many of our priesthood brethren are living below their privileges and the lords expectations we must go forward confident of the supernal power of the priesthood it is a source of strength and encouragement to know who we are and what we have and what we must do in the work of the almighty the lord has said i the lord am bound when ye do what i say but when ye do not what i say ye have no promise28 homes without the priesthood are to be watched over and ministered to by the quorums of the priesthood in this manner no blessings will be found wanting in any dwelling within the church years ago a family gathered at the bedside of an aged little danish woman among them was her middleaged wayward son for the past number of years he had been living at home tearfully he pleaded mama youve got to live mama you cant die he said mama you cant go i wont let you go the little mother looked up at her son and in her broken danish accent said but ver is yo powahwhere is your power paul said we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit29 that the work of the lord will prevail is not a question that we must marshal all of our efforts and unify ourselves are givens the authority of the priesthood is with us after all that we have correlated and organized it is now our responsibility to activate the power of the priesthood in the church authority in the priesthood comes by way of ordination power in the priesthood comes through faithful and obedient living in honoring covenants it is increased by exercising and using the priesthood in righteousness now fathers i would remind you of the sacred nature of your calling you have the power of the priesthood directly from the lord to protect your home there will be times when all that stands as a shield between your family and the adversarys mischief will be that power you will receive direction from the lord by way of the gift of the holy ghost the adversary is not actively disturbing our church meetingsperhaps only occasionally by and large we are free to assemble as we wish without much disruption but he and those who follow him are persistent in attacking the home and the family the ultimate end of all activity in the church is that a man and his wife and their children might be happy at home protected by the principles and laws of the gospel sealed safely in the covenants of the everlasting priesthood every law and principle and power every belief every ordinance and ordination every covenant every sermon and every sacrament every counsel and correction the sealings the calls the releases the serviceall these have as their ultimate purpose the perfection of the individual and the family for the lord has said this is my work and my gloryto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man30 i bear witness of the power of the priesthood given to the church to protect us and guide us and because we have that we have no fear of the future fear is the opposite of faith we move forward certain that the lord will watch over us particularly in the family of him i bear witness in the name of jesus christ amen notes thomas s monson correlation brings blessings relief
