mothers and daughters by elder m russell ballard of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder m russell ballard in these last days it is essentialeven criticalthat parents and children listen to and learn from one another brothers and sisters six months ago i spoke in the priesthood session of general conference to fathers and sons as you might expect my 5 daughters 24 granddaughters and everincreasing number of greatgranddaughters have been asking for equal time so today i will speak primarily to the mothers and daughters of the church my dear wife barbara has had an eternally significant influence on our daughters and granddaughtersand they in turn on her mothers and daughters play a critical role in helping each other explore their infinite possibilities despite the undermining influences of a world in which womanhood and motherhood are being corrupted and manipulated speaking to the women of the church nearly a century ago president joseph f smith said it is not for you to be led by the women of the world it is for you to lead the women of the world in everything that is praiseworthy everything that is godlike everything that is uplifting and purifying to the children of men teachings of presidents of the church joseph f smith 1998 184 sisters we your brethren cannot do what you were divinely designated to do from before the foundation of the world we may try but we cannot ever hope to replicate your unique gifts there is nothing in this world as personal as nurturing or as life changing as the influence of a righteous woman i understand that some of you young women do not have mothers with whom you can discuss these issues and many of you women do not presently have daughters in your lives but because all women have within their divine nature both the inherent talent and the stewardship to mother most of what i will say applies equally to grandmothers aunts sisters stepmothers mothersinlaw leaders and other mentors who sometimes fill the gaps for these significant motherdaughter relationships young women your mothers adore you they see in you the promise of future generations everything you accomplish every challenge you overcome brings them pure joy and likewise your worries and heartaches are their worries and heartaches today i wish to give you young women some suggestions on how to take full advantage of your relationship with your mother and then i have a few thoughts to share with mothers about how they can maximize their influence with their daughters as well as the other members of their families it is unfortunately all too easy to illustrate the confusion and distortion of womanhood in contemporary society immodest immoral intemperate women jam the airwaves monopolize magazines and slink across movie screensall while being celebrated by the world the apostle paul spoke prophetically of perilous times that will come in the last days and specifically referenced something that may have seemed particularly perilous to him silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts 2 timothy 31 6 popular culture today often makes women look silly inconsequential mindless and powerless it objectifies them and disrespects them and then suggests that they are able to leave their mark on mankind only by seductioneasily the most pervasively dangerous message the adversary sends to women about themselves and so my dear young women with all my heart i urge you not to look to contemporary culture for your role models and mentors please look to your faithful mothers for a pattern to follow model yourselves after them not after celebrities whose standards are not the lords standards and whose values may not reflect an eternal perspective look to your mother learn from her strengths her courage and her faithfulness listen to her she may not be a whiz at texting she may not even have a facebook page but when it comes to matters of the heart and the things of the lord she has a wealth of knowledge as you approach the time for marriage and young motherhood she will be your greatest source of wisdom no other person on earth loves you in the same way or is willing to sacrifice as much to encourage you and help you find happinessin this life and forever love your mother my young sisters respect her listen to her trust her she has your best interests at heart she cares about your eternal safety and happiness so be kind to her be patient with her imperfections for she has them we all do now may i share a few thoughts with you mothers about the special role you play in your daughters lives we have a family friend who travels often with members of her extended family her primary observation after each trip is how much the young women behave like their mothers if the mothers are thrifty so are their daughters if the mothers are modest so are the girls if the mothers wear flipflops and other casual clothing to sacrament meeting so do their daughters mothers your example is extremely important to your daughterseven if they dont acknowledge it throughout the history of the world women have always been teachers of moral values that instruction begins in the cradle and continues throughout the lives of their children today our society is bombarded with messages about womanhood and motherhood that are dangerously and wickedly wrong following these messages can put your daughters on the path to sin and selfdestruction your daughters may not understand that unless you tell them or better unless you show them how to make good choices as mothers in israel you are your daughters first line of defense against the wiles of the world now mothers i understand that it sometimes appears that our children arent paying attention to the lessons were trying to teach them believe meive seen that glazedover look that comes to the eyes of teenagers just when youre coming to what you think is the best part of your instruction let me assure you that even when you think your daughter is not listening to a thing you say she is still learning from you as she watches you to see if your actions match your words as ralph waldo emerson is believed to have said what you do speaks so loud that i cannot hear what you say see ralph keyes the quote verifier 2006 56 teach your daughters to find joy in nurturing children this is where their love and talents can have the greatest eternal significance consider in this context president harold b lees injunction that the most important work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes teachings of presidents of the church harold b lee 2000 134 this is true for all of us of course but it is especially powerful when considering the relationship of mothers and daughters mothers teach your daughters that a faithful daughter of god avoids the temptation to gossip or judge one another in a sermon to the relief society of nauvoo the prophet joseph counseled the tongue is an unruly memberhold your tongues about things of no moment teachings of presidents of the church joseph smith 2007 455 in recent years there has been a rash of articles books and films written about women and girls who gossip and who are mean satan is always attempting to undermine the most precious element of a womans divine naturethe nature to nurture a motherdaughter relationship is where a daughter learns how to nurture by being nurtured she is loved she is taught and experiences firsthand what it feels like to have someone care about her enough to correct her while continuing to encourage and believe in her at the same time remember sisters god is the source of all moral and spiritual power we gain access to that power by entering into covenants with him and keeping those covenants mothers teach your daughters the importance of making covenants and then show them how to keep those covenants in such a way that they will desire to live worthy to go to the temple in todays world this means talking to your daughters about sexual matters your daughters as well as your sons are coming of age in a world that openly embraces early casual and thoughtless promiscuity immodest unchaste women are glamorized and all too often celebrated and emulated while there are steps that we can take in our homes and families to minimize our exposure to these unsavory elements of contemporary living your daughters cannot entirely avoid the blatant sexual messages and enticements that surround them you need to have frequent open discussions during which you teach your daughters the truth about these issues for example they need to understand that when they wear clothing that is too tight too short or too low cut they not only can send the wrong message to young men with whom they associate but they also perpetuate in their own minds the fallacy that a womans value is dependent solely upon her sensual appeal this never has been nor will it ever be within the righteous definition of a faithful daughter of god they need to hear thisclearly and repeatedlyfrom your lips and they need to see it modeled correctly and consistently in your own personal standards of dress grooming and modest living all youth will be more likely to make and keep covenants if they learn how to recognize the presence and the voice of the spirit teach your daughters about things of the spirit point them to the scriptures give them experiences that will help them cherish the blessing of priesthood power in their lives through keeping covenants they will learn to hear the voice of the lord and receive personal revelation god will truly hear and answer their prayers the mutual theme for 2010 applies to our youth as well as to all of us be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest joshua 19 this will lead them safely to the blessings of the house of the lord make sure they know that keeping covenants is the safest road to eternal happiness and if needed teach them how to repent and how to remain pure and worthy now if this has a familiar sound my brothers and sisters its because ive been speaking to parents and their children for three general conferences in a row last april i encouraged the youth to learn the lessons of the past from that talk i quote when you are willing to listen and learn some of lifes most meaningful teachings come from those who have gone before you how much better your life will be if you will follow the noble example of the faithful followers of christ learning the lessons of the past liahona and ensign may 2009 31 33 last october i spoke to fathers and sons in priesthood meeting and today i have spoken mostly to mothers and daughters in each case my message has been different but similar i hope you are listening and see a pattern and hear a steady consistent message that in these last days it is essentialeven criticalthat parents and children listen to and learn from one another these are not just ethereal concepts about which i have been speaking they are the essence the center of gods plan for our eternal happiness and peace the church will help wherever we can we are there to support and sustain you as parents and as children but the home is the most important place to prepare the youth of today to lead the families and the church of tomorrow it rests upon each one of us as mothers and fathers to do all we can to prepare our youth to be faithful righteous men and women it is in the home where we must teach the gospel by precept and by example i conclude my counsel with this prophetic summary from president joseph f smith our family associations are not exclusively intended for this life for time as we distinguish it from eternity we live for time and for eternity we form associations and relations for time and all eternity who are there besides the latterday saints who contemplate the thought that beyond the grave we will continue in the family organization the father the mother the children recognizing each other this family organization being a unit in the great and perfect organization of gods work and all destined to continue throughout time and eternity teachings joseph f smith 385 386 may god bless us to teach nurture and prepare one another within the walls of our homes for the great work that must be done by all of us now and in the future is my prayer in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
