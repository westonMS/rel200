to the fathers in israel by president ezra taft benson president of the church imagepresident ezra taft benson my dear brethren i am grateful to be here with you in this glorious assembly of the priesthood of god i pray that the spirit of the lord will be with me and with you as i address you on a most vital subject this evening i would like to speak to the fathers assembled here and throughout the church about their sacred callings i hope you young men will also listen carefully inasmuch as you are now preparing to become the future fathers of the church fathers yours is an eternal calling from which you are never released callings in the church as important as they are by their very nature are only for a period of time and then an appropriate release takes place but a fathers calling is eternal and its importance transcends time it is a calling for both time and eternity president harold b lee truly stated that the most important of the lords work that you fathers will ever do will be the work you do within the walls of your own home home teaching bishoprics work and other church duties are all important but the most important work is within the walls of your home strengthening the home pamphlet 1973 p 7 what then is a fathers specific responsibility within the sacred walls of his home may i suggest two basic responsibilities of every father in israel first you have a sacred responsibility to provide for the material needs of your family the lord clearly defined the roles of providing for and rearing a righteous posterity in the beginning adam not eve was instructed to earn the bread by the sweat of his brow the apostle paul counsels husbands and fathers but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel 1 tim 58 early in the history of the restored church the lord specifically charged men with the obligation to provide for their wives and family in january of 1832 he said verily i say unto you that every man who is obliged to provide for his own family let him provide and he shall in nowise lose his crown dc 7528 three months later the lord said again women have claim on their husbands for their maintenance until their husbands are taken dc 832 this is the divine right of a wife and mother while she cares for and nourishes her children at home her husband earns the living for the family which makes this nourishing possible in a home where there is an ablebodied husband he is expected to be the breadwinner sometimes we hear of husbands who because of economic conditions have lost their jobs and expect the wives to go out of the home and work even though the husband is still capable of providing for his family in these cases we urge the husband to do all in his power to allow his wife to remain in the home caring for the children while he continues to provide for his family the best he can even though the job he is able to secure may not be ideal and family budgeting may have to be tighter also the need for education or material things does not justify the postponing of children in order to keep the wife working as the breadwinner of the family i remember the counsel of our beloved prophet spencer w kimball to married students he said i have told tens of thousands of young folks that when they marry they should not wait for children until they have finished their schooling and financial desires they should live together normally and let the children come i know of no scriptures president kimball continued where an authorization is given to young wives to withhold their families and go to work to put their husbands through school there are thousands of husbands who have worked their own way through school and have reared families at the same time marriage is honorable in speeches of the year 1973 provo brigham young university press 1974 p 263 brethren of the priesthood i continue to emphasize the importance of mothers staying home to nurture care for and train their children in the principles of righteousness as i travel throughout the church i feel that the great majority of latterday saint mothers earnestly want to follow this counsel but we know that sometimes the mother works outside of the home at the encouragement or even insistence of her husband it is he who wants the items of convenience that the extra income can buy not only will the family suffer in such instances brethren but your own spiritual growth and progression will be hampered i say to all of you the lord has charged men with the responsibility to provide for their families in such a way that the wife is allowed to fulfill her role as mother in the home fathers another vital aspect of providing for the material needs of your family is the provision you should be making for your family in case of an emergency family preparedness has been a longestablished welfare principle it is even more urgent today i ask you earnestly have you provided for your family a years supply of food clothing and where possible fuel the revelation to produce and store food may be as essential to our temporal welfare today as boarding the ark was to the people in the days of noah also are you living within your income and saving a little are you honest with the lord in the payment of your tithes living this divine law will bring both spiritual and material blessings yes brethren as fathers in israel you have a great responsibility to provide for the material needs of your family and to have the necessary provisions in case of emergency second you have a sacred responsibility to provide spiritual leadership in your family in a pamphlet published some years ago by the council of the twelve we said the following fatherhood is leadership the most important kind of leadership it has always been so it always will be so father with the assistance and counsel and encouragement of your eternal companion you preside in the home father consider your ways pamphlet 1973 pp 45 however along with that presiding position come important obligations we sometimes hear accounts of men even in the church who think that being head of the home somehow puts them in a superior role and allows them to dictate and make demands upon their family the apostle paul points out that the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church eph 523 italics added that is the model we are to follow in our role of presiding in the home we do not find the savior leading the church with a harsh or unkind hand we do not find the savior treating his church with disrespect or neglect we do not find the savior using force or coercion to accomplish his purposes nowhere do we find the savior doing anything but that which edifies uplifts comforts and exalts the church brethren i say to you with all soberness he is the model we must follow as we take the spiritual lead in our families particularly is this true in your relationship with your wife here again the counsel from the apostle paul is most beautiful and to the point he said simply husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church eph 525 in latterday revelation the lord speaks again of this obligation he said thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart and shalt cleave unto her and none else dc 4222 to my knowledge there is only one other thing in all scripture that we are commanded to love with all our hearts and that is god himself think what that means this kind of love can be shown for your wives in so many ways first and foremost nothing except god himself takes priority over your wife in your lifenot work not recreation not hobbies your wife is your precious eternal helpmateyour companion what does it mean to love someone with all your heart it means to love with all your emotional feelings and with all your devotion surely when you love your wife with all your heart you cannot demean her criticize her find fault with her or abuse her by words sullen behavior or actions what does it mean to cleave unto her it means to stay close to her to be loyal and faithful to her to communicate with her and to express your love for her love means being sensitive to her feelings and needs she wants to be noticed and treasured she wants to be told that you view her as lovely and attractive and important to you love means putting her welfare and selfesteem as a high priority in your life you should be grateful that she is the mother of your children and the queen of your home grateful that she has chosen homemaking and motherhoodto bear to nourish to love and to train your childrenas the noblest calling of all husbands recognize your wifes intelligence and her ability to counsel with you as a real partner regarding family plans family activities and family budgeting dont be stingy with your time or with your means give her the opportunity to grow intellectually emotionally and socially as well as spiritually remember brethren love can be nurtured and nourished by little tokens flowers on special occasions are wonderful but so is your willingness to help with the dishes change diapers get up with a crying child in the night and leave the television or the newspaper to help with the dinner those are the quiet ways we say i love you with our actions they bring rich dividends for such little effort this kind of loving priesthood leadership applies to your children as well as to your wife mothers play an important role as the heart of the home but this in no way lessens the equally important role fathers should play as head of the home in nurturing training and loving their children as the patriarch in your home you have a serious responsibility to assume leadership in working with your children you must help create a home where the spirit of the lord can abide your place is to give direction to all family life you should take an active part in establishing family rules and discipline your homes should be havens of peace and joy for your family surely no child should fear his own fatherespecially a priesthood father a fathers duty is to make his home a place of happiness and joy he cannot do this when there is bickering quarreling contention or unrighteous behavior the powerful effect of righteous fathers in setting an example disciplining and training nurturing and loving is vital to the spiritual welfare of his children with love in my heart for the fathers in israel may i suggest ten specific ways that fathers can give spiritual leadership to their children give fathers blessings to your children baptize and confirm your children ordain your sons to the priesthood these will become spiritual highlights in the lives of your children personally direct family prayers daily scripture reading and weekly family home evenings your personal involvement will show your children how important these activities really are whenever possible attend church meetings together as a family family worship under your leadership is vital to your childrens spiritual welfare go on daddydaughter dates and fatherandsons outings with your children as a family go on campouts and picnics to ball games and recitals to school programs and so forth having dad there makes all the difference build traditions of family vacations and trips and outings these memories will never be forgotten by your children have regular oneonone visits with your children let them talk about what they would like to teach them gospel principles teach them true values tell them you love them personal time with your children tells them where dad puts his priorities teach your children to work and show them the value of working toward a worthy goal establishing mission funds and education funds for your children shows them what dad considers to be important encourage good music and art and literature in your homes homes that have a spirit of refinement and beauty will bless the lives of your children forever as distances allow regularly attend the temple with your wife your children will then better understand the importance of temple marriage and temple vows and the eternal family unit have your children see your joy and satisfaction in service to the church this can become contagious to them so they too will want to serve in the church and will love the kingdom oh husbands and fathers in israel you can do so much for the salvation and exaltation of your families your responsibilities are so important remember your sacred calling as a father in israelyour most important calling in time and eternitya calling from which you will never be released may you always provide for the material needs of your family and with your eternal companion at your side may you fulfill your sacred responsibility to provide the spiritual leadership in your home to this end i pray in the name of jesus christ amen
