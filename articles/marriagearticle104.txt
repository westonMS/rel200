family strong and close and worthy of our father in heavens blessings as you do you will receive faith and hope and strength which will bless your lives forever next young women may i admonish you to participate in a program of daily reading and pondering of the scriptures we remember the experience of our beloved prophet president spencer w kimball as a fourteenyearold boy he accepted the challenge of reading the bible from cover to cover most of his reading was done by coal oil light in his attic bedroom he read every night until he completed the 1519 pages which took him approximately a year but he attained his goal of the four great standard works of the churchthe bible the book of mormon the doctrine and covenants and the pearl of great pricei would particularly urge you to read again and again the book of mormon and ponder and apply its teachings the book of mormon was referred to by the prophet joseph smith as the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of our religion and a man and woman would get nearer to god by abiding by its precepts than by any other book history of the church 4461 young women the book of mormon will change your life it will fortify you against the evils of our day it will bring a spirituality into your life that no other book will it will be the most important book you will read in preparation for lifes challenges a young woman who knows and loves the book of mormon who has read it several times who has an abiding testimony of its truthfulness and who applies its teachings will be able to stand against the wiles of the devil and will be a mighty tool in the hands of the lord further i would encourage you young sisters as you approach your teenage years to receive a patriarchal blessing study it carefully and regard it as personal scripture to youfor that indeed is what it is a patriarchal blessing is an inspired and prophetic statement of your lifes mission together with such blessings cautions and admonitions as the patriarch may be prompted to give heber j grant j reuben clark jr david o mckay in messages of the first presidency of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints comp james r clark 6 vols salt lake city bookcraft 196575 6194 young women receive your patriarchal blessing under the influence of fasting and prayer and then read it regularly that you may know gods will for you may i now direct your attention to the importance of attending all of your church meetings faithful attendance at church meetings brings blessings you can receive in no other way attend your sacrament meeting every sunday listen carefully to the messages pray for the spirit of understanding and testimony partake of the sacrament with clean hands and a pure heart attend your sunday school classes every sunday listen carefully to the lessons and participate in class discussions gospel scholarship and an increase in testimony will result attend your young women meetings every sunday and your weekly activities learn well your responsibilities in the gospel and then perform them with diligence regularly attend seminary and be a seminary graduate seminary instruction is one of the most significant spiritual experiences a young woman can have young women take full advantage of the church programs set your goals to attain excellence in the achievement programs of the church the personal progress program for young women is an excellent goaloriented program its purpose is to help you develop the qualities and virtues of exemplary latterday saint young women earn the young womanhood recognition award and proudly wear the gold medallion do not settle for mediocrity in this great incentive program for the young women of the church may i now speak with you about missionary service in the kingdom i feel very deeply about this i pray that you will understand the yearnings of my heart the prophet joseph smith declared after all that has been said our greatest and most important duty is to preach the gospel history of the church 2478 the lord wants every young man to serve a fulltime mission presently only a third of the eligible young men in the church are serving fulltime missions this is not pleasing to the lord we can do better we must do better not only should a mission be regarded as a priesthood duty but every young man should look forward to this experience with great joy and anticipation a young man can do nothing more important school can wait scholarships can be deferred occupational goals can be postponed yes even temple marriage should wait until after a young man has served an honorable fulltime mission for the lord now why do i mention this to you young women this evening because you can have a positive influence in motivating young men to serve fulltime missions let the young men of your acquaintance know that you expect them to assume their missionary responsibilities that you personally want them to serve in the mission field because you know thats where the lord wants them avoid steady dating with a young man prior to the time of his mission call if your relationship with him is more casual then he can make that decision to serve more easily and also can concentrate his full energies on his missionary work instead of the girlfriend back home and after he returns honorably from his mission he will be a better husband and father and priesthood holder having first served a fulltime mission there is no question that faithful latterday saint young women can have a great impact for good in helping young men to magnify their priesthood and to motivate them to good works and to be their best selves remember young women you may also have the opportunity to serve a fulltime mission i am grateful my own eternal companion served a mission in hawaii before we were married in the salt lake temple and i am pleased that i have had three granddaughters serve fulltime missions some of our finest missionaries are young sisters i would now like to speak to you about personal purity solomon said that the price of a virtuous woman is far above rubies prov 3110 young women guard and protect your virtue as you would your very life we want you to live the morally clean life all of your life we want the morally clean life to be your way of life yes one can repent of moral transgression the miracle of forgiveness is real and true repentance is accepted of the lord but it is not pleasing to the lord to sow ones wild oats to engage in sexual transgression of any nature and then expect that planned confession and quick repentance will satisfy the lord president kimball was emphatic on this point in his marvelous book the miracle of forgiveness he stated that man or woman who resists temptation and lives without sin is far better off than the man or woman who has fallen no matter how repentant the latter may be how much better it is never to have committed the sin salt lake city bookcraft 1969 p 357 one of our fine stake presidents shared with us the following experience i remember a girl that i had gone to high school with she was from a good lds family but when she was a junior in high school she began to compromise her standards and principles i remember how stunned i was one afternoon as a group of us were in the back of the bus riding home from school and we were talking about the consequences of sin or transgression and she flatly announced that she wasnt worried about committing any sin because her bishop had told her she could easily repent and could be quickly forgiven well i was shocked with this flippant attitude that didnt reflect any understanding of repentance and no appreciation of the miracle of forgiveness i was also sure that she had grossly misunderstood the instruction and counsel of her bishop adultery or anything like unto it is abominable in the sight of the lord president kimball also wisely observed among the most common sexual sins our young people commit are necking and petting not only do these improper relations often lead to fornication pregnancy and abortionall ugly sinsbut in and of themselves they are pernicious evils and it is often difficult for youth to distinguish where one ends and another begins too often young people dismiss their petting with a shrug of their shoulders as a little indiscretion while admitting that fornication is a base transgression too many of them are shocked or feign to be when told that what they have done in the name of petting was in reality a form of fornication the miracle of forgiveness pp 6566 young sisters be modest modesty in dress and language and deportment is a true mark of refinement and a hallmark of a virtuous latterday saint woman shun the low and the vulgar and the suggestive together with the young men of the aaronic priesthood remember the scriptural injunction be ye clean that bear the vessels of the lord isa 5211 3 ne 2041 remember the story of joseph in egypt who hearkened not to the wife of potiphar and maintained his purity and virtue see gen 39721 consider carefully the words of the prophet alma to his errant son corianton forsake your sins and go no more after the lusts of your eyes alma 399 the lusts of your eyes in our day what does that expression mean movies television programs and video recordings that are both suggestive and lewd magazines and books that are obscene and pornographic we counsel you young women not to pollute your minds with such degrading matter for the mind through which this filth passes is never the same afterward dont see rrated movies or vulgar videos or participate in any entertainment that is immoral suggestive or pornographic and dont accept dates from young men who would take you to such entertainment also dont listen to music that is degrading remember elder boyd k packers statement music once innocent now is often used for wicked purposes in our day music itself has been corrupted music can by its tempo by its beat by its intensity and i would add by its lyrics dull the spiritual sensitivity of men and women young people elder packer goes on to say you cannot afford to fill your mind with this unworthy hard music of our day ensign jan 1974 pp 25 28 instead we encourage you to listen to uplifting music both popular and classical that builds the spirit learn some favorite hymns from our new hymnbook that build faith and spirituality attend dances where the music and the lighting and the dance movements are conducive to the spirit watch those shows and entertainment that lift the spirit and promote clean thoughts and actions read books and magazines that do the same remember young women the importance of proper dating president kimball gave some wise counsel on this subject clearly right marriage begins with right dating therefore this warning comes with great emphasis do not take the chance of dating nonmembers or members who are untrained and faithless a girl may say oh i do not intend to marry this person it is just a fun date but one cannot afford to take a chance on falling in love with someone who may never accept the gospel the miracle of forgiveness pp 24142 our heavenly father wants you to date young men who are faithful members of the church who will be worthy to take you to the temple and be married the lords way there will be a new spirit in zion when the young women will say to their boyfriends if you cannot get a temple recommend then i am not about to tie my life to you even for mortality and the young returned missionary will say to his girlfriend i am sorry but as much as i love you i will not marry out of the holy temple my young sisters we have such hope for you we have such great expectations for you dont settle for less than what the lord wants you to be as the prophet nephi exclaims in 2 nephi 3120 2 ne 3120 wherefore ye must press forward with a steadfastness in christ having a perfect brightness of hope and a love of god and of all men wherefore if ye shall press forward feasting upon the word of christ and endure to the end behold thus sayeth the father ye shall have eternal life yes give me a young woman who loves home and family who reads and ponders the scriptures daily who has a burning testimony of the book of mormon give me a young woman who faithfully attends her church meetings who is a seminary graduate who has earned her young womanhood recognition award and wears it with pride give me a young woman who is virtuous and who has maintained her personal purity who will not settle for less than a temple marriage and i will give you a young woman who will perform miracles for the lord now and throughout eternity now i would like to say a final word to the mothers and to the leaders of these wonderful young women mothers stay close to your daughters earn and deserve their love and respect be united with their father in the rearing of your children do nothing in your life to cause your daughters to stumble because of your example teach your daughters to prepare for lifes greatest careerthat of homemaker wife and mother teach them to love home because you love home teach them the importance of being a fulltime mother in the home my eternal companion has wisely counseled mothers radiate a spirit of contentment and joy with homemaking you teach by example your attitude toward homemaking your attitude will say to your daughters i am only a housewife or it will convey homemaking is the highest most noble profession to which a woman might aspire priesthood leaders remember the bishops first and foremost responsibility is the aaronic priesthood and the young women of his ward bishops stay close to both your young men and young women give as much attention to the young womens program in your ward as you do the young mens programs be as concerned about the young womens activities and classes their campouts and socials their firesides and conferences as you are the young mens recognize with equal prominence the presentation of the young womanhood recognition award as you do the awarding of the duty to god award and eagle scout badge spend the necessary time and it takes time in personal interviews with the young women of your ward talk with them regularly about their goals and aspirations their challenges and their personal worthiness be a bishop who really cares about each of the young men and young women in his ward to the young women leaders who are here this evening may you truly love the young sisters with whom you are working get inside their lives be a true friend and counselor to them perform your stewardship well with all the energy of your heart help bring them back to our father in heaven clean and sweet and pure now in closing

your divine potential remember who you are and the divine heritage that is yoursyou are literally the royal daughters of our father in heaven o youth of the noble birthright with all my heart i say
