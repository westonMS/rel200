little children by elder boyd k packer of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder boyd k packer some years ago dr faun hunsaker then president of the southern states mission was invited to stay at the home of a member he arrived after the children were in bed he occupied the parents bedroom and during the night heard the door open and the sound of little feet a little boy frightened by a bad dream had come to his parents bed for comfort sensing that something was different the little boy felt brother hunsakers face so he spoke quietly to the child the startled youngster said youre not my daddy no im not your daddy did my daddy say you could sleep here yes your daddy said i could sleep here with that the little youngster crawled into bed with brother hunsaker and was soon asleep i might well conclude with that lesson on the trust of a little child nevertheless without apology i intend to moralize about innocence and our obligation to little children there is much in the scriptures about little children the psalmist wrote children are an heritage of the lord ps 1273 the savior gave the everfamiliar plea suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of heaven mark 1014 when his disciples asked who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said whosoever shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me matt 1815 then came this warning but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea matt 186 to me the most impressive lesson is in the book of mormon jesus commanded that their little children should be brought so they brought their little children and set them down upon the ground round about him and jesus stood in the midst he commanded the multitude that they should kneel down upon the ground and it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground jesus groaned within himself and said father i am troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of israel he himself also knelt upon the earth and behold he prayed unto the father and the things which he prayed cannot be written and no tongue can speak neither can there be written by any man neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as they both saw and heard jesus speak and they arose from the earth and he said unto them blessed are ye because of your faith and now behold my joy is full and when he had said these words he wept and the multitude bare record of it and he took their little children one by one and blessed them and prayed unto the father for them and when he had done this he wept again and he said unto them behold your little ones and they saw the heavens open and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire and they came down and encircled those little ones about and they were encircled about with fire and the angels did minister unto them 3 ne 171115 17 2024 there is more much more in the scriptures about little children there is a sorry side to this subject as well i wish not to dwell on that beyond listing four transgressions which plague mankind all of which inflict suffering upon little children first that consummate physical union of man and woman belonging to the marriage covenant is now falsely proclaimed an acceptable indulgence for any two adults second the misuse of that procreative power in degraded acts of perversion is widely promoted as the right of consenting adults this selfish behavior carries neither the responsibility nor the rewards of parenthood third the deliberate destruction of the innocent and helpless by abortion is now widely fosteredeven publicly funded fourth the bodies and minds and morals of increasing numbers of little children are brutalized and abused by those who should protect them in it all mankind has sown a bitter wind and reaps heartbreak guilt abandonment divorce addiction disease and death and little children suffer if these sins remain unchecked civilization will be led unfailingly to destruction our behavior is not totally controlled by natural impulses behavior begins with belief as well beliefs are born of philosophies of doctrines doctrines can be spiritual or secular wholesome or destructive true or false two doctrines misrepresent the status of little children each is widely accepted both are false the first holds that little children are conceived in sin and enter mortality in a state of natural corruption that doctrine is false each time a child is born the world is renewed in innocence the revelations teach us that the glory of god is intelligence or in other words light and truth light and truth forsake that evil one every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning and god having redeemed man from the fall men became again in their infant state innocent before god and that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth through disobedience from the children of men and because of the tradition of their fathers but i have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth dc 933640 italics added mormon taught this doctrine to his son moroni and hence to us i can present only a few sentences from his letter if i have learned the truth mormon wrote there have been disputations among you concerning the baptism of your little children moro 85 he called their disputation gross error and wrote immediately after i had learned these things of you i inquired of the lord concerning the matter and the word of the lord came to me by the power of the holy ghost saying listen to the words of christ your redeemer your lord and your god behold i came into the world not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance the whole need no physician but they that are sick wherefore little children are whole for they are not capable of committing sin wherefore the curse of adam is taken from them in me that it hath no power over them and after this manner did the holy ghost manifest the word of god unto me wherefore my beloved son i know that it is solemn mockery before god that ye should baptize little children moro 879 mormon told moroni to teach repentance and baptism to those who are accountable and capable of committing sin moro 810 eight is established by revelation as the age of accountability see dc 6827 then in sternness unsurpassed in scripture mormon warned he that supposeth that little children need baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity for he hath neither faith hope nor charity wherefore should he be cut off while in the thought he must go down to hell for awful is the wickedness to suppose that god saveth one child because of baptism and the other must perish because he hath no baptism wo be unto them that shall pervert the ways of the lord after this manner for they shall perish except they repent behold i speak with boldness having authority from god moro 81416 read his entire epistle it is true doctrine it will inspire a reverence for little children thereafter who could even think to neglect much less to abuse one of them true doctrine understood changes attitudes and behavior the study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior preoccupation with unworthy behavior can lead to unworthy behavior that is why we stress so forcefully the study of the doctrines of the gospel the laws of god on marriage birth and nurturing of little children may seem rigid but they are very practical his law decrees that the only legitimate union of man and woman is between husband and wife for should that expression of love result in conception marriage provides shelter for the child who enters mortality innocent and helpless marriage ensures security and happiness for parents as well whatever the laws of man may come to tolerate the misuse of the power of procreation the destroying of innocent life through abortion and the abuse of little children are transgressions of enormous proportion for cradled therein rests the destiny of innocent helpless children another doctrine equally false and widely accepted also misrepresents the status of little children let me illustrate years ago two of our sons then little fellows were wrestling on the rug they reached that line which separates laughter from tears so i worked my foot carefully between them and lifted the older one back to a sitting position on the rug as i did so i said hey there you little monkeys youd better settle down to my surprise he folded his little arms his eyes swimming with deep hurt and protested i not a monkey daddy i a person the years have not erased the overwhelming feeling of love i felt for my little boys many times over the years his words have slipped back into my mind i not a monkey daddy i a person i was taught a profound lesson by my little son he is not just a person nor just my little boy he is a child of god the cycle of life has moved swiftly on now both of those sons have little children of their own who teach their fathers lessons they now watch their children grow as we watched them they are coming to know as fathers something they could not be taught as sons all too soon their children will be grown with little persons of their own repeating the endless cycle of life perhaps now they understand what it means to begin our prayers as the lord instructed our father who art in heaven he is our father we are his children this secular doctrine holds that man is not a child of god but basically an animal his behavior inescapably controlled by natural impulse exempt from moral judgments and unaccountable for moral conduct while many claim that this philosophy could not in the end lead mankind to relaxed moral behavior something causes it is it accidental that the more widely such secular doctrines are believed the more prevalent immoral behavior becomes they defend their philosophy with collected data and say it is now proven to be true look at all the evidence on our side we in turn point to the sorry way in which mankind degrades procreation and the attendant suffering of both children and adults and say look at all the evidence on our side secular doctrines have the advantage of convincing tangible evidence we seem to do better in gathering data on things that can be counted and measured doctrines which originate in the light on the other hand are more often supported by intangible impressions upon the spirit we are left for the most part to rely on faith but in time the consequences of following either will become visible enough to you adults who repeat the pattern of neglect and abuse you endured as little children believing that you are entrapped in a cycle of behavior from which there is no escape i say it is contrary to the order of heaven for any soul to be locked into compulsive immoral behavior with no way out it is consistent with the workings of the adversary to deceive you into believing that you are i gratefully acknowledge that transgressions even those which affect little children yield to sincere repentance i testify with all my soul that the doctrine of repentance is true and has a miraculous liberating effect upon behavior to you innocent ones who have not transgressed but were abused as little children and still carry an undeserved burden of guilt i say learn true doctrinerepentance and forgiveness lay that burden of guilt down for we are all children of the same heavenly father may not each of his children of any age claim the redeeming sacrifice of jesus christ and in so doing through complete repentance be cleansed and renewed to childlike innocence i said at the beginning that i might well conclude with the account of that trusting little child i think i will do just that youre not my daddy no im not your daddy did my daddy say you could sleep here yes your daddy said i could sleep here with that the little boy was soon safely asleep in his arms god grant that all little children will be safe with every one of us because their father and their god and our father and our god said we could be here in the name of jesus christ amen
