marriage and divorce by elder david b haight of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder david b haight i pray for the companionship of the holy spirit that my remarks will be in harmony with revealed truth and will be received and understood by that same heavenly influence for more than twentyfive years we have witnessed an unending assault on the traditional family sacred values of human goodness discipline and love and honor for god our eternal father have been challenged a new selfcentered generation has made the family a prime target of continuing belittlement marriage is downgraded or shunned parenthood degraded and avoided these with other disturbing influences have resulted in a torrent of evil temptations for socalled instant gratification and the demeaning of marriage and the sacred roles of wife and mother unfortunately there are many good human beings who would live differently but they do not know of gods eternal plan for his children we learn from the scriptures that the divine intent is that marriage is to be an eternal union with enduring family relationships throughout eternity scripture reveals that after the earth was developed god created man in his own image and gave him dominion over the earth by the side of man stood the woman sharing with him the divinely bestowed honor and dignity of supremacy over all other creations god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him an help meet for him gen 218 in the image of god created he him male and female created he them gen 127 the lord also instructed therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh gen 224 thereby giving sanction to the union of male and female in authorized marriage which is heavenplanned for the creation of mortal bodies the earliest recorded commandment to adam and eve was to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth gen 128 we regard children as gifts from god committed to our care for loving nurturing and careful training the lord also instructed and they shall also teach their children to pray and to walk uprightly before the lord dc 6828 they are not to be mistreated or abused for with their parents they are part of a family with the potential of eternal relationship president spencer w kimball explained the lord organized the whole program in the beginning with a father who procreates provides and loves and directs and a mother who conceives and bears and nurtures and feeds and trains the lord could have organized it otherwise but chose to have a unit with responsibility and purposeful associations where children train and discipline each other and come to love honor and appreciate each other the family is the great plan of life as conceived and organized by our father in heaven ensign july 1973 p 15 marriage was meant to be and can be a loving binding and harmonious relationship between a husband and wife as we contemplate our lords declaration to moses this is my work and my gloryto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man moses 139 we reflect with sadness upon the present serious trend of families and homes being torn apart through divorce it would seem that a major underlying cause of divorce is in not understanding that marriage and families are godgiven and godordained if we understood the full meaning we would have less divorce and its attendant unhappiness couples would plan for a happy marriage relationship based on divine instruction if couples understood from the beginning of their romance that their marriage relationship could be blessed with promises and conditions extending into the eternities divorce would not even be a considered alternative when difficulties arise the current philosophyget a divorce if it doesnt work outhandicaps a marriage from the beginning the everincreasing rise in divorce is ample evidence of how acceptable divorce has become as the popular solution to unhappy or notquiteuptoexpectation marriages but no matter how acceptable divorce has becomehow quick and easy to obtaindivorce is tragic and painful not only at the outset but also in the years to come divorce can never really be final how can mothers and fathers really divorce themselves from their own flesh and blood children or from the memories of days and years of shared experiences which have become part of their very lives divorce rarely occurs without immense emotional social and financial upheaval most people underestimate the alienation bitterness disruption and frustration between a divorcing couple and among their children friends and relatives some never adjust to the resulting emotional consequences perhaps most tragic of all is that more than 60 percent of all divorces involve children under eighteen years of age children of divorce all too often have a higher delinquency rate and less selfconfidence and tend to be more promiscuous and themselves more likely to have unhappy marriages considering the enormous importance of marriage it is rather astonishing that we dont make better preparation for success usually young couples date for a few months or for a year or two enjoying romance and getting acquainted and then get married once married they soon learn that romance must blend with spiritual beliefs inlaw relationships money issues and serious discussions involving ethics children and the running of a home too many people are inadequately prepared for this lofty responsibility people go to college for years to prepare for a vocation or profession not nearly as rewarding or as important as marriage see lowell s bennion conference on utah families salt lake tribune 6 apr 1980 p f9 serious transgressions as well as injured lives that sometimes are revealed in bishops offices all too frequently make it clear that husband and wife relationships deserve a great deal more prayerful attention than many are giving it fewer marriages would get in trouble and more would be happier if couples visited a warmhearted bishop who might suggest ways of avoiding pitfalls and encourage husbands and wives to thoughtfully use selfdiscipline and needed restraint and develop the loving attribute of unselfishness a few years ago president harold b lee received this letter from a married woman when we thought that the end was here and that there was only one thing to do and that was to get a divorce we had been told that we should counsel with our bishop at first we hesitated because he was just a young man but he was our bishop so we went to see him we poured out our souls to our young bishop he sat and listened silently and when we ran out of conversation he said simply well my wife and i we had problems too and we learned how to solve them that is all he said but you know there was something that happened as a result of that young bishops statement we walked out of there and we said well if they can solve their problems what is the matter with us ensign jan 1974 p 100 a prominent producer recently stated in movies and on television there is reluctance to deal with marriage except as a comic turn or in soap operas we prefer to stress sexual involvement and leave alone the happilyeverafter as in childrens fairy stories karl e meyer the wife of your youth palos heights illinois np 1977 np our concern is not just that media producers and writers dont portray happy fruitful marriage but that many married couples dont take their marriages seriously enoughto work at them protect them nurture them cultivate them day in and day out week in and week out yearlong quartercentury long halfacentury long forever middleage divorce is particularly distressing as it indicates that mature people who are the backbone of our society are not working carefully enough to preserve their marriages divorces granted to people over fortyfive have increased at an alarming rate when middleaged people even consider breaking up their marriagea couple who may have reared their children who possibly have grandchildrenand now decide to go their separate ways they need to realize that every divorce is the result of selfishness on the part of one or both in malachi we read the lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou hast dealt treacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth mal 21415 marriage is a covenant two of the ten commandments deal directly with preserving the sanctity of marriage thou shalt not commit adultery and thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife ex 2014 17 jesus magnified the law against adultery but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart matt 528 the ideal marriage is the faithfulness of a man and a woman to each other a faithfulness that began when each had chosen the other in proverbs we read let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth prov 518 let her affection fill you at all times with delight and be infatuated always with her love see prov 519 it is a privilege indeed to live our life with the wife of our youth to enjoy the golden years togetherneither objecting to the wrinkles nor the gray hairbut to continue acquiring a depth of love oneness and wisdom which can be shared with each other now and throughout all eternity marriage is sustained by faith and knowledge of its divine establishment and is sustained daily by the energy of love a wise man explained when the satisfaction or the security of another person becomes as significant to one as ones own satisfaction and security then the state of love exists harry stack sullivan concepts of modern psychiatry 2d ed new york w w norton and co 1961 p 42 a strong shared conviction that there is something eternally precious about a marriage relationship builds faith to resist evil marriage should be beautiful and fulfilling with joy beyond our fondest dreams for neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord 1 cor 1111 latterday saints need not divorcethere are solutions to marriage problems if as husband and wife you are having serious misunderstandings or if you feel
