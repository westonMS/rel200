a lasting marriage by elder robert l simpson of the first quorum of the seventy imageelder robert l simpson my thoughts today are centered in the concern we all share over a growing crisis in todays world a sort of spreading cancer which continues to eat away at the family unit which has been ordained of god divorce with all of its diabolic side effects threatens the very foundations of society president joseph f smith observed marriage is the preserver of the human race without it the purposes of god would be frustrated virtue would be destroyed to give place to vice and corruption and the earth would be void and empty gospel doctrine 5th ed salt lake city deseret book company 1939 p 272 each prophet of this dispensation has said essentially the same thing in his own way according to data from the national center for health statistics nearly two million divorces are being granted this year in the united states this is the highest number ever recorded and three times the number reported just twenty years ago most nations of the world seem to be following a similar trend today more than one out of every three marriages is terminating in divorce families within the church unfortunately are following this world pattern to an alarming degree and it should not be so us news world report recently quoted herbert a glieberman a recognized authority on divorce and domestic relations as follows the biggest rise in the divorce rate has been among couples married 10 years or longer its not uncommon today for couples 25 and 30 years into their marriage to seek and obtain a divorce he then identifies the main cause no 1 he states is the couples inability to talk honestly with each other bare their souls and treat each other as their best friend they talk about mostly superficial things in order to impress one another and then he continues i find that too many people talk right through each other rather than to each other he concludes the lack of communication brings on drinking infidelity or physical or mental abuse for many there is a lack of tolerance an inability to bear discomfort or to recognize that theyre not perfect and neither is their mate why so many marriages fail us news world report 20 july 1981 pp 5354 there is really only one way to ensure good family communication and that is the lords way he advocates the council method the church is made up of councils certainly one of the most important of all church councils must be the family council presided over by the husband and the wife in this council parents should stand equally yoked together just as they are meant to share equally in every priesthood blessing that accrues to their family circle through the eternities the lords eternal objective for a married couple is that they become one next the lord instructs us to reason together dc 5010no arguing no haranguing no backbiting but rather reasoning together with softspoken voices what a great example for the children how can a family go wrong if each major decision is carefully measured by gospel teachings and then after reasoning together the decision can be made to move forward confidently and in harmony with divine law the savior taught the extra mile see matt 541 which means unselfishness by just going the extra mile almost every couple could make their marriage relationship successful but an extra effort on just one side of the boat means imbalance and a capsized marriage is likely unselfishness must come from both sides every couple whether in the first or the twentyfirst year of marriage should discover the value of pillowtalk time at the end of the daythe perfect time to take inventory to talk about tomorrow and best of all its a time when love and appreciation for one another can be reconfirmed the end of another day is also the perfect setting to say sweetheart i am sorry about what happened today please forgive me you see we are all still imperfect and these unresolved differences allowed to accumulate day after day add up to a possible breakdown in the marital relationshipall for the want of better communication and too often because of foolish pride the church has always taken a firm stand against dictatorships of any form any man who chooses to administer the office of his calling as a priesthood leader in the home by dictatorial methods is out of harmony with gospel teaching he will not enjoy the spiritual rewards of reasoning together his pillow talk will cease to be a twoway communication and rebellion will usually follow dictators are always quick to issue an ultimatum and in case you have not discovered an ultimatum to todays youth is almost guaranteed failure it is the equivalent of waving a red flag it is like declaring war on those you love the lord warns us that no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood only by persuasion by longsuffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned by kindness and pure knowledge which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy and without guile dc 1214142 i like the advice given by president joseph f smith he said this to fathers it is only when men depart from the right spirit when they digress from their duty that they will neglect or dishonor any soul that is committed to their care they are bound to honor their wives and children gospel doctrine p 285 there is yet another major cause for divorce that should not go unattended the mismanagement of family financial resources to pay tithes and offerings while ignoring the balance of heavenly fathers advice concerning sound judgment in family finances will probably cause the windows of heaven to stick a little bit the promised blessings will not likely be forthcoming as expected every prophet in this dispensation has taught in clear unmistakable terms that the saints should stay out of debt we heard it again this morning from president kimball that we should not participate in somethingfornothing schemes which has been stressed today he advises us to be frugal to save and to earn our money the oldfashioned way by the sweat of our face we are admonished to teach our children the ethic of work we have been encouraged at every turn to set the proper example of industry and thrift and also to be generous and consistent in our offerings to the poor and the needy during these days of a strained economy it is imperative that the family live within these divine injunctions each husband and wife needs to reason together about the family budget on a regular basis if downward adjustments need to be made in the family spending habits it is far better to do what needs to be done now rather than build up to an impossible financial crisis later ona crisis that too often leads to the divorce courts few things are as destructive in a marriage as the statement sweetheart i just signed up today for a 200 course at the local health spa a wellplanned health course may be just the thing but not as a surprise addition to an already strained budget this could have been and should have been a prime topic for pillow talk beforehand as elder neal a maxwell told us so well recently if your companion is going to participate in a crash landing then she should also help file the flight plan now quickly just to mention three items as foundation stones to a secure marriage first faith the first principle of the gospel it must be the first principle of your marriagenot only faith in god and in his beloved son not only in the living prophet but may i also suggest a sincere and evergrowing faith in each other and also in your children second obedience often referred to as the first law of heaven without obedience to gods laws there could be no blessings obedience to our covenants with the lord is a prerequisite to peace and love within the family circle third loyalty loyalty to a companion through thick and thin will develop a basic character trait so strong that loyalty to the church and true principles will follow just as naturally as the night follows the day the law of chastity is one of the ten commandments this demands loyalty in marriage brothers and sisters protect this sacred principle as though your life depended upon it because gospel truth confirms that your eternal life most certainly does depend upon fidelity in your marriage the scriptures confirm the eternal truth that marriage is ordained of god dc 4915 and then this neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord 1 cor 1111 and according to a prophet in this dispensation god not only commends but he commands marriage while man was yet immortal before sin had entered the world our heavenly father himself performed the first marriage he united our first parents in the bonds of holy matrimony and commanded them to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth this command he has never changed abrogated or annulled but it has continued in force throughout all the generations of mankind smith gospel doctrine p 274 mark confirms what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder mark 109 now brothers and sisters every divorce in the church affects the work of the kingdom adversely there needs to be greater effort on the part of each companion threatened by divorce there needs to be more counseling not only one with another but also with appropriate priesthood leaders there needs to be a more universal understanding about the eternal nature of the marriage covenant time and experience have proven that unselfishness is the key to successful marriage for you see unselfishness invites reasoning together unselfishness insists on an extramile effort unselfishness paves the way for family financial security unselfishness stops divorce and dont you agree that perhaps the most important questions that will need to be answered by a divorced person in the hereafter will be these did you do everything possible to save your marriage were gospel truths applied to the fullest did you seek out listen to and abide by priesthood counsel may he bless us to regard every marriage as an act ordained of god for as president joseph f smith said it is the hope of the human race and these thoughts i leave with you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
