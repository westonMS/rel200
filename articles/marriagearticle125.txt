three important questions by elder elray l christiansen assistant to the council of the twelve imageelder elray l christiansen im grateful my brothers and sisters for the muchneeded downtoearth counsel given us this morning by the lords spokesman president spencer w kimball as well as for the timely and helpful remarks of the other speakers who have preceded me timely because the lord has said for i will raise up unto myself a pure people that will serve me in righteousness dc 10016 purge ye out the iniquity which is among you sanctify yourselves before me and ye shall be endowed with power dc 4311 16 brothers and sisters you will soon see that our subjects are not assigned all i can say since i will talk about the same things elder hinckley has talked about is somebody here needs a double dose on that premise i shall proceed and in what i shall say i also have in mind those of you particularly who have yet to answer and resolve three important questions whom shall i marry where shall i marry by whom shall i be married there are different ways of doing things but surely in anything we do theres no better way than the right wayand the lords way is the right way fortunately his way has been made plain and is plainly revealed seldom is the problem one of knowing what to do its a matter rather of having the wisdom and the will to do what we know is right probably the most consequential event in your lives takes place when you are united in marriage it will have a farreaching effect upon your future like the ripples caused by a pebble cast upon a placid pool the decision you make in regard to where with whom and by whom this event will take place will affect not only you but the lives of many others especially your children in fact it will likely affect generations to come in a matter of such vast importance it is imperative that sober thought be given to marriage long before it takes place we must realize that marriage is designed by the lord for a divine purpose whereby a servant and handmaiden of the lord may prepare themselves in righteousness to receive chosen spirits coming from our eternal father and give them bodies of flesh for their mortal probation and then undertake with all the power at their command to lead these spirit children entrusted into their care back into the presence of god from whence they came such children are legal heirs to the kingdom and to all its blessings and promises discourses of brigham young p 195 true love is not earthbound it is as eternal as our spirits which never die a continuing association in this life as well as in the next with those we love should be the great desire of every person it is the ultimate it is the great purpose of mortality persons who are satisfied with a temporary legal arrangement which terminates at death when it could be an everlasting contract are basing their marriage on shallow and fleeting love such a marriage looks to the moment not to the future under the stress of life it is more likely to crumble and fall true love pleads for endless association of those we love but an eternal relationship of families does not come about automatically as some suppose it must not only be planned for it must be earned we must realize that only when we have lived in complete harmony with all the laws and ordinances of the priesthood including those received in holy temples should we expect to find ourselves prepared to dwell in what i sometimes refer to as the kingdom of familiesthe celestial world in a revelation given to the prophet joseph smith the lord has said and they who are not sanctified through the law which i have given unto you even the law of christ must inherit another kingdom even that of a terrestrial kingdom or that of a telestial kingdom for he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory dc 8821 22 he would just not feel at home surely then our desire and our goal should be to prepare ourselves not for a fragment of joy but for the fulness thereof which is to be found only in the celestial world how fortunate it is that after its absence from the earth for hundreds of years the lord has revealed anew the principle of eternal marriage and has restored the divine authority to administer it it is here it is ours to embrace and it is disappointing to see that in too many instances those who live close to these holy places pass them by and go the way of the world when it comes to the most momentous event in their lives with the knowledge that it is the lords way and therefore the right way no latterday saint with a concordant spirit would deviate from it some may say why not try a civil marriage first and then if it works out we will go to the temple later well in my opinion the time to be married right is when youre married can we consign the lords prescribed way to a secondary position we cannot when you consider the incomparable blessings and promises that may be realized in a marriage that may be perpetuated through the eternities ahead of you as compared with a temporary association your desire your determination should be to take hold of and ensure these blessings and promises if ever there is a time to be realistic and to act in the light of things as they really are if ever there is a time to use your heads so to speak and plan wisely it is when the thought of marriage first enters your minds when two souls have a true love for each other a genuine tender affection not merely physical attraction when they are really united in spirit having the same lofty ideals the same beliefs and standards trusting each other confiding in each other when there is sincere respect one for the other along with virtue and purity of life when such people are joined together through the sealing ordinances their marriage if continued on such a basis should give them the assurance and comfort in the thought that even though death may separate them yet in the resurrection shall they come forth and live in the family relationship forever it is your earthly life that you are now living my young friends you will live it but once there will be no reruns no repeat performances what you are in this life determines where you will be throughout eternity it is your future your destiny that you are now molding you made good in that preearth life you were valiant there you must not now fumble the ball on the 20year line when you do take the wrong course you are undoing the work of your prior existence for there you struggled for ages to prepare for mortality where you now are i urge you to carefully consider these things as you make preparations for the future you who stand on the threshold of marriage you who have been taught the eternity of life should strive with all your might to be worthy of entering a temple of the lord there to be sealed to your companion for endless time in the right way in the right place by the right authority i testify to the truths and the reality that these powers to seal on earth and to have them binding in heaven are with us they have been restored by heavenly messengers and we have the power amongst us let us not pass it by i testify to my knowledge that god lives that he is our father that jesus is the savior of the world and that the gospel has been restored in the fulfillment of prophecy both of the old and the new testament prophets and i do it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
