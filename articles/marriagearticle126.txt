the marriage that endures by elder gordon b hinckley of the council of the twelve imageelder gordon b hinckley my beloved brethren and sisters i am grateful for the invocation offered by brother kan watanabe my friend and associate with whom i have traveled many thousands of miles up and down japan in the ministry of the lord and i have been inspired by the music of this chorus of priesthood holders of brigham young university students there is something stirring and beautiful about their voices if the holy spirit will direct me i think i should like to address my remarks to them even though they are seated behind me in so doing i also speak to youth across the entire church it is springtime in this part of the world the season when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love alfred lord tennyson locksley hall it is april when young men and women dream of june weddings as an introduction may i tell of two experiences the first happened not long ago when i was at the new washington dc temple a number of newsmen were present on that occasion they were curious concerning this beautiful building different from other church buildingsdifferent in concept different in purpose different concerning those who will be permitted within its sacred precincts i explained that after the building is dedicated as the house of the lord only members of the church in good standing will be authorized to enter but that prior to its dedication for a period of from a month to six weeks visitors will be made welcome to tour the entire structure that we are not disposed to hide it from the world but that following the dedication we shall regard it as being of so sacred a nature that purity of life and strict adherence to standards of the church become qualifications for admittance we talked of the purposes for which temples are built i explained those purposes particularly emphasizing that purpose which appeals to all thoughtful men and women namely marriage for eternity as i did so i reflected on an experience at the time of the prededication showing of the london temple in 1958 on that occasion thousands of curious but earnest people stood in long lines to gain entry to the building a policeman stationed to direct traffic observed that it was the first time he had ever seen the english eager to get into a church those who inspected the building were asked to defer any questions until they had completed the tour in the evenings i joined the missionaries in talking with those who had questions as a young couple came down the front steps of the temple i inquired whether i could help them in any way the young woman spoke up and said yes what about this marriage for eternity to which reference was made in one of the rooms we sat on a bench under the ancient oak that stood near the gate the wedding band on her finger indicated that they were married and the manner in which she gripped her husbands hand evidenced their affection one for another now to your question i said i suppose you were married by the vicar yes she responded just three months ago did you realize that when the vicar pronounced your marriage he also decreed your separation what do you mean she quickly retorted you believe that life is eternal dont you of course she replied i continued can you conceive of eternal life without eternal love can either of you envision eternal happiness without the companionship of one another of course not came the ready response but what did the vicar say when he pronounced your marriage if i remember the language correctly he said among other things in sickness and in health for richer or for poorer for better or for worse till death do ye part he went as far as he felt his authority would permit him and that was till death separates you in fact i think that if you were to question him he would emphatically deny the existence of marriage and family beyond the grave but i continued the father of us all who loves his children and wants the best for them has provided for a continuation under proper circumstances of this most sacred and ennobling of all human relationships the relationships of marriage and family in that great and moving conversation between the savior and his apostles wherein peter declared thou art the christ the son of the living god and the lord responded blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven the lord then went on to say to peter and his associates and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven matt 161319 in that marvelous bestowal of authority the lord gave to his apostles the keys of the holy priesthood whose power reaches beyond life and death into eternity this same authority has been restored to the earth by those same apostles who held it anciently even peter james and john i continued by saying that following the dedication of the temple on the following sunday those same keys of the holy priesthood would be exercised in behalf of the men and women who come into this sacred house to solemnize their marriage they will be joined in a union which death cannot dissolve and time cannot destroy such was my testimony to this young couple in england such it is to you today my dear young friends and such it is to all the world our father in heaven who loves his children desires for them that which will bring them happiness now and in the eternities to come and there is no greater happiness than is found in the most meaningful of all human relationshipsthe companionships of husband and wife and parents and children a few days ago i was called to the hospital bedside of a mother in the terminal stages of a serious illness she passed away a short time later leaving her husband and four children including a little boy of six there was sorrow deep and poignant and tragic but shining through their tears was a faith beautiful and certain that as surely as there was now a sorrowful separation there would someday be a glad reunion for that marriage had begun with a sealing for time and eternity in the house of the lord under the authority of the holy priesthood every man who truly loves a woman and every woman who truly loves a man hopes and dreams that their companionship will last forever but marriage is a covenant sealed by authority if that authority is of the state alone it will endure only while the state has jurisdiction and that jurisdiction ends with death but add to the authority of the state the power of the endowment given by him who overcame death and that companionship will endure beyond life if the parties to the marriage live worthy of the promise when i was much younger and less brittle we danced to a song whose words went something like this is love like a rose that blossoms and grows then withers and goes when summer is gone it was only a dance ballad but it was a question that has been asked through the centuries by men and women who loved one another and looked beyond today into the future of eternity to that question we answer no and reaffirm that love and marriage under the revealed plan of the lord are not like the rose that withers with the passing of summer rather they are eternal as surely as the god of heaven is eternal but this gift precious beyond all others comes only with a pricewith selfdiscipline with virtue with obedience to the commandments of god these may be difficult but they are possible under the motivation that comes of an understanding of truth brigham young once declared there is not a young man in our community who would not be willing to travel from here to england to be married right if he understood things as they are there is not a young woman in our community who loves the gospel and wishes its blessings that would be married in any other way discourses of brigham young p 195 many have traveled that far and even farther to receive the blessings of temple marriage i have seen a group of latterday saints from japan who had denied themselves food to make possible the long journey to the hawaii temple in london we met those who had gone without necessities to afford the 7000 mile flight from south africa to the temple in surrey england there was a light in their eyes and smiles on their faces and testimonies from their lips that it was worth infinitely more than all it had cost and i remember hearing in new zealand the testimony of a man from the far side of australia who having been previously sealed by civil authority and then joined the church with his wife and children had traveled all the way across that wide continent then across the tasman sea to auckland and down to the temple in the beautiful valley of the waikata as i remember his words he said we could not afford to come our worldly possessions consisted of an old car our furniture and our dishes i said to my family we cannot afford to go then i looked into the faces of my beautiful wife and our beautiful children and i said we cannot afford not to go if the lord will give me strength i can work and earn enough for another car and furniture and dishes but if i should lose these my loved ones i would be poor indeed in both life and in eternity how shortsighted so many of us are how prone to look only at today without thought for the morrow but the morrow will surely come as will also come death and separation how sweet is the assurance how comforting is the peace that come from the knowledge that if we marry right and live right our relationship will continue notwithstanding the certainty of death and the passage of time men may write love songs and sing them they may yearn and hope and dream but all of this will be only a romantic longing unless there is an exercise of authority that transcends the powers of time and death speaking from this pulpit many years ago president joseph f smith said the house of the lord is a house of order and not a house of confusion and that means that there is no union for time and eternity that can be perfected outside of the law of god and the order of his house men may desire it they may go through the form of it in this life but it will be of no effect except it be done and sanctioned by divine authority in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost gospel doctrine 197172 melchizedek priesthood course of study vol 2 p 1 in conclusion may i leave you a story it is fiction but in principle it is true can you imagine two young people at a time when the moon is full and the roses are in bloom and a sacred love has matured between them johnny says to mary mary i love you i want you for my wife and the mother of our children but i dont want you or them forever just for a season and then goodbye and she looking at him through tears in the moonlight says johnny youre wonderful theres nobody else in all the world like you i love you and i want you for my husband and the father of our children but only for a time and then farewell that sounds foolish doesnt it and yet isnt that in effect what a boy says to a girl and a girl says to a boy in a proposal of marriage when given the opportunity of eternal union under the new and everlasting covenant but rather they choose to set it aside for a substitute that can last only until death comes life is eternal the god of heaven has also made possible eternal love and eternal family relationships god bless you my dear young friends that as you look forward to marriage you may look not only for rewarding companionship and rich and fruitful family relationships through all of your mortal days but to an even better estate where love and treasured associations may be felt and known under a promise given of god i bear witness of the living reality of the lord jesus christ through whom this authority has come i bear witness that his power his priesthood is among us and is exercised in his holy houses do not spurn that which he has offered live worthy of it and partake of it and let the sanctifying power of his holy priesthood seal your companionship for these blessings i humbly pray in your behalf as i bear testimony and witness of these truths in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
