guidelines to carry forth the work of god in cleanliness by president spencer w kimball president of the church imagepresident spencer w kimball my brothers and sisters and friends another april has come and with it the birthdate of the church organized on the birthday of our lord and savior jesus christ which we have celebrated on the sixth of april this weekend we conduct the 144th annual conference of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints the last three conferences we had as our leader president harold b lee whom we miss greatly today he was a man of many talents of great strength and courage and with an obsession to follow the instructions of the lord since december 26 we have been lonely without him he was as a high peak in a mighty range of impregnable mountains he has become an important part of eternity sister jo m shaw has written lines in memory of him and may i quote those words as i express humbly but sincerely our love and affection for president harold b lee we are grateful to have sister lee with us today in memory of a prophet of god president harold b lee a prophet died and at his grave stood mourning saints of god we wept and heaven wept her tears splashed on the winter sod some lived and died and never knew the value of his word because they never knew he was a prophet of the lord some found his comfort far away and never saw his face nor touched his hand nor heard his voice still knew his gentle grace some lived near the prophets heart and knelt with him in prayer acquainted with a noble man they knew his kind watchcare i bless his name because i knew and know and shall remember the day i wept and heaven wept one sad day in december we would not have had it thus but now the only thing for us to do is press forward firmly in the press conferences an everrecurring question has been asked us mr president what are you going to do now that you have the leadership of the church in your hands my answer has been that for the past 30 years as a member of the council of the twelve apostles i have had a little to do with the making of policies and the formation of the present extensive full and comprehensive program i anticipate no major changes in the immediate future but do hope to give increased emphasis to some of the programs already established this is a day of consolidating our efforts and firming up our programs and reaffirming our policies we recognize our greatest problem is our rapid growth our increase in numbers is phenomenal for the population has doubled in these past few years thirty years ago we counted our members in hundreds of thousands and today over three million there were 146 stakes in 1943 when i first visited stakes and today there are some 635 stakes there were 38 missions in 1943 today there are 107 in 1943 there were no stakes overseas and now 70 this unprecedented growth pleases us but challenges us tremendously we are interested in numbers only incidentally we are obsessed first to see that all men obtain eternal life the monumental challenge in 1974 then is to provide trained leadership for the fastmultiplying units of members and to help that membership to keep clean from that world in which they must live may we then reaffirm some vital matters which concern us one is our civil obligations we are approaching election time when we must choose again those persons who will represent us in positions of responsibility in our civil governmentfederal state and local early in this dispensation the lord made clear the position his restored church should take with respect to civil government in the revelation he gave to the prophet joseph smith he said and now verily i say unto you concerning the law of the land which is constitutional supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges that it belongs to all mankind and is justifiable before me therefore i the lord justify you in befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land dc 9846 in harmony with this statement the church later adopted as one of its articles of faith we believe in being subject to kings presidents rulers and magistrates in obeying honoring and sustaining the law a of f 112 in 1835 at a general assembly the church adopted by unanimous vote a declaration of belief regarding governments and laws in general in which it said we believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic or the will of the sovereign dc 1343 in 1903 president joseph f smith said the church as such does not engage in politics its members belong to the political parties at their own pleasure the probable cause improvement era june 1903 p 626 and in the october conference in 1951 the first presidency said a threat to our unity derives from unseemly personal antagonisms developed in partisan political controversy the church while reserving the right to advocate principles of good government underlying equity justice and liberty the political integrity of officials and the active participation of its members and the fulfillment of their obligations in civic affairs exercises no constraint on the freedom of individuals to make their own choices and affiliations any man who makes representation to the contrary does so without authority and justification in fact president stephen l richards conference report october 1951 pp 11415 now these statements we reaffirm as setting forth the position of the church today concerning civil government and politics furthermore in order to implement our divine charge to seek for such civil officers as will administer the law in equity and justice we urge church members to attend the mass meetings of their respective political parties and there exercise their influence every latterday saint should sustain honor and obey the constitutional law of the land in which he lives along with our unprecedented growth our next problem is definitely the worldnot the high ranges and the wide valleys and the hot deserts and the deep oceans but the pattern of life to which too many of our people gear their lives love not the world neither the things that are in the world said john if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world 1 jn 21516 the encroachment of the world into our lives is threatening how hard it seems for many of us to live in the world and yet not of the world through isaiah the word of the lord comes and i will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible isa 1311 when satan took the lord into an exceeding high mountain he promised all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me matt 49 these things were the dens of vice and areas of sin and physical gratification and lustful temptations long ago the lord made his plans with great precision and announced them saying for behold this is my work and my gloryto bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man moses 139 his further words that ye might be sanctified from all sin and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world and eternal life in the world to come even immortal glory moses 659 now the works of the flesh are many as given by paul perilous times shall come they are upon us for men shall be lovers of their own selves without natural affection incontinent 2 tim 313 with vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another inventors of evil things rom 126 27 30 thieves drunkards extortioners ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god james 44 these are some of the ugly acts and activities that we call the world just before the crucifixion the lord pleaded i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil john 1715 this is the prayer we continually utter and our major effort is to see that the members of the church are sanctified through their righteousness these ugly transgressions paul called doctrines of devils and their authors seducing spirits see 1 tim 41 these distortions of the normal life have not changed in this century except possibly to grow more vile and permissive and vulgar and degenerate and we plead with our people everywhere submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you james 47 our sermon is one of reaffirmation and reassurance we urge our people to stand in holy places dc 4532 what we are saying today is not new doctrine but as old as the day of creation there may be some who have a general feeling of uneasiness because of world conditions and lengthening shadows of evil but the lord said if ye are prepared ye shall not fear dc 3830 and again peace i leave with you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid john 1427 you have come here seeking guidance it is the purpose of your leaders to give that direction as the brethren speak you will feel the inspiration of our lord the gospel gives purpose in our lives it is the way to happiness sister eliza r snow wrote of our lord he marked the path and led the way and every point defines to light and life and endless day where gods full presence shines lds hymns no 68 now the family is basic we are children of our heavenly father and as he loves us so our souls are bound up in our posterity all the morals are woven into the warp and woof of the gospel of christ the lighted way then brings us to normal clean courting of young men and women coming eventually to a virtuous union at an altar where a fully authorized servant of god seals the union for eternity the hebrew saints were properly taught marriage is honourable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge heb 134 and to those who might decry marriage or postpone it or forbid it paul spoke condemning them it is generally selfishness cold and selfcentered which leads people to shun marriage responsibility there are many who talk and write against marriage even some of our own delay marriage and argue against it to all who are deceived by these doctrines of devils we urge the return to normalcy we call upon all people to accept normal marriage as a basis for true happiness the lord did not give sex to man for a plaything basically marriage presupposes a family the psalmist said lo children are an heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them ps 1273 5 certainly anyone who purposely denies himself or herself honorable parenthood is to be pitied for the great joy of parenthood is fundamental in the normal full life and we remember the command of god in the beginning be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it gen 128 then the recorder writes and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good gen 131 in our dispensation comes the doctrine for virgins are given unto man to multiply and replenish the earth according to gods commandment and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds that they may bear the souls of men for herein is the work of my father continued that he may be glorified dc 13263 we decry the prevalence of broken homes every man should love his wife and cherish and protect her all the days of their lives and she should love honor and appreciate her husband and we hear the historian moses quoting his lord therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh gen 224 paul says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church eph 522 23 25 2829 this is often misunderstood both by husbands and by wives consider it well and do not contend nor argue with your heavenly father when a man gives leadership in his home as christ gives leadership in his church little else can be desired analyze the divorces of which you know and you will find so often selfishness is in them most divorces are unwarranted and come of weakness and selfishness and often result in great unhappiness for the divorced persons and also almost irreparable damage and frustration to the unfavored children who are torn and disturbed certainly selfishness is near its greatest peak when innocent children must suffer for the sins of their parents almost like a broken record come from divorcees that it is better to have them grow up in a singleparent home than a fighting home the answer to that specious argument is there need be no battling parents in fighting homes someone checked a long list of divorces and found that almost all of them came about through selfishness where people were determined to get as much as they could and give as little as possible it was found in this survey that about 90 percent gave as the reason for the breakup immorality on the part of one or both of the participants immorality is totally selfish can you think of a single unselfish element in that sin accordingly if two good people will discard selfishness generally they can be compatible again abortion is a growing evil that we speak against certainly the terrible sin of premeditated abortion would be hard to justify it is almost inconceivable that an abortion would ever be committed to save face or embarrassment to save trouble or inconvenience or to escape responsibility how could one submit to such an operation or be party in any way by financing or encouraging if special rare cases could be justified certainly they would be rare indeed we place it high on the list of sins against which we strongly warn the people abortion must be considered one of the most revolting and sinful practices in this day when we are witnessing the frightful evidence of permissiveness leading to sexual immorality priesthood bulletin february 1973 p 1 as to drugs the church has consistently opposed the improper and harmful use of drugs or similar substances under circumstances which would result in addiction physical or mental impairment or in lowering moral standards we reaffirm this positive statement then in the area of one of satans most destructive evils we strongly warn all our people from childhood to old age to beware of the chains of bondage suffering and remorse which come from improper use of the body the human body is the sacred home of the spirit child of god and unwarranted tampering with or defilement of this sacred tabernacle can bring only remorse and regret we urge stay clean uncontaminated undefiled jude says there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lusts jude 118 we urge with peter abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul 1 pet 211 no indecent exposure or pornography or other aberrations to defile the mind and spirit no fondling of bodies ones own or that of others and no sex between persons except in proper marriage relationships this is positively prohibited by our creator in all places at all times and we reaffirm it even in marriage there can be some excesses and distortions no amount of rationalization to the contrary can satisfy a disappointed father in heaven in this connection we quote a paragraph from a popular evangelist billy graham the bible celebrates sex and its proper use presenting it as godcreated godordained godblessed it makes plain that god himself implanted the physical magnetism between the sexes for two reasons for the propagation of the human race and for the expression of that kind of love between man and wife that makes for true oneness his command to the first man and woman to be one flesh was as important as his command to be fruitful and multiply the bible makes plain that evil when related to sex means not the use of something inherently corrupt but the misuse of something pure and good it teaches clearly that sex can be a wonderful servant but a terrible master that it can be a creative force more powerful than any other in the fostering of a love companionship happiness or can be the most destructive of all of lifes forces billy graham what the bible says about sex readers digest may 1970 p 118 we reaffirm again our strong unalterable stand against unchastity in all of its many manifestations now our mothers have a sacred role the following is a partial quote from the first presidency of the church we reaffirm it strongly motherhood thus becomes a holy calling a sacred dedication for carrying out the lords plans a consecration of devotion to the uprearing and fostering the nurturing in body mind and spirit of those who kept their first estate and who come to this earth for their second estate to see if they will do all things whatsoever the lord their god shall command them abr 325 to lead them to keep their second estate is the work of motherhood and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever this divine service of motherhood can be rendered only by mothers it may not be passed to others nurses cannot do it public nurseries cannot do it hired help cannot do itonly mother aided as much as may be by the loving hands of father brothers and sisters can give the full needed measure of watchful care the mother who entrusts her child to the care of others that she may do nonmotherly work whether for gold for fame or for civic service should remember that a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame prov 2915 in our day the lord has said that unless parents teach their children the doctrines of the church the sin be upon the heads of the parents dc 6825 motherhood is near to divinity it is the highest holiest service to be assumed by mankind it places her who honors its holy calling and service next to the angels to you mothers in israel we say god bless and protect you and give you the strength and courage the faith and knowledge the holy love and consecration to duty that shall enable you to fill to the fullest measure the sacred calling which is yours to you mothers and motherstobe we say be chaste keep pure live righteously that your posterity to the last generation may call you blessed message of the first presidency deseret news weekly church edition october 1942 p 5 this then is our program to reaffirm and boldly carry forward the work of god in cleanliness uprightness and to take that gospel of truth to that world that needs so much that godly life eternal life is our goal it can be reached only by following the path our lord has marked out for us i know this is true and right i love our heavenly father and i love his son and i am proud to be even a weak vessel to push forward their great eternal work i testify to all this humbly sincerely in the name of jesus christ amen
