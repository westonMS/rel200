meeting the challenges of todays world by elder robert d hales of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder robert d hales the choices you makemission education marriage career and service in the churchwill shape your eternal destiny much has been written and said about todays generation of young adults research shows that many resist organized religion many are in debt and unemployed a majority like the idea of marriage but many are reluctant to take that step a growing number dont want children without the gospel and inspired guidance many are wandering in strange paths and losing their way fortunately young adult members of the church lag behind in these troubling trends in part because they are blessed with the gospel plan that eternal plan includes holding fast to the iron rodcleaving to gods word and the word of his prophets we need to tighten our grip on the rod that leads us back to him now is the day of choosing1 for all of us as a boy when i was about to make a poorly considered choice my father sometimes would say robert straighten up and fly right you have been there in the spirit of his plain talk i would like to speak specifically to the youththe noble youthand noble young adults for my soul delighteth in plainness that we may learn2 you are living through a critical period of your life the choices you makemission education marriage career and service in the churchwill shape your eternal destiny this means you will always be looking aheadlooking to the future as a pilot in the air force i learned this principle never deliberately fly into a thunderstorm i wont tell you how i found that out instead fly around it take another route or wait for the storm to clear before landing beloved young adult brothers and sisters i want to help you fly right in the gathering storms of the last days you are the pilots you are responsible to think about the consequences of every choice you make ask yourself if i make this choice what is the worst thing that could happen your righteous choices will keep you from getting off course think of it if you choose not to take a drink of alcohol you will not become an alcoholic if you never choose to go into debt you will avoid the possibility of bankruptcy one of the purposes of the scriptures is to show us how righteous people respond to temptation and evil in short they avoid it joseph ran from potiphars wife3 lehi took his family and left jerusalem4 mary and joseph fled into egypt to escape herods wicked plot5 in every instance heavenly father warned these believers similarly he will help us know whether to fight flee or go with the flow of our unfolding circumstances he will speak to us through prayer and when we pray we will have the holy ghost who will guide us we have the scriptures the teachings of living prophets patriarchal blessings the counsel of inspired parents priesthood and auxiliary leaders and above all the still small voice of the spirit the lord will always keep his promise i will lead you along6 the only question is will we let ourselves be led will we hear his voice and the voice of his servants i testify that if you are there for the lord he will be there for you7 if you love him and keep his commandments you will have his spirit to be with you and guide you put your trust in that spirit which leadeth to do good by this shall you know all things pertaining unto things of righteousness8 with those principles as a foundation may i give you some practical counsel many of your generation are facing crushing debt when i was a young adult my stake president was an investment banker on wall street he taught me you are rich if you can live happily within your means how can you do it pay your tithing and then save when you earn more save more dont compete with others to have expensive toys dont buy what you cant afford many young adults in the world are going into debt to get an education only to find the cost of school is greater than they can repay seek out scholarships and grants obtain parttime employment if possible to help pay your own way this will require some sacrifice but it will help you succeed education prepares you for better employment opportunities it puts you in a better position to serve and to bless those around you it will set you on a path of lifelong learning it will strengthen you to fight against ignorance and error as joseph smith taught knowledge does away with darkness suspense and doubt for these cannot exist where knowledge is in knowledge there is power9 to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of god10 education will prepare you for what is ahead including marriage again may i speak frankly the track that leads to marriage passes through the terrain called dating dating is the opportunity for lengthy conversations when you date learn everything you can about each other get to know each others families when possible are your goals compatible do you share the same feelings about the commandments the savior the priesthood the temple parenting callings in the church and serving others have you observed one another under stress responding to success and failure resisting anger and dealing with setbacks does the person you are dating tear others down or build them up is his or her attitude and language and conduct what you would like to live with every day that said none of us marry perfection we marry potential the right marriage is not only about what i want its also about what shewhos going to be my companionwants and needs me to be speaking plainly please dont date all through your 20s just to have a good time thus delaying marriage in favor of other interests and activities why because dating and marriage arent final destinations they are the gateway to where you ultimately want to go therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife11 your responsibility now is to be worthy of the person you want to marry if you want to marry a wholesome attractive honest happy hardworking spiritual person be that kind of person if you are that person and you are not married be patient wait upon the lord i testify that the lord knows your desires and loves you for your faithful devotion to him he has a plan for you whether it be in this life or the next listen to his spirit seek not to counsel the lord but to take counsel from his hand12 in this life or the next his promises will be fulfilled if ye are prepared ye shall not fear13 if you dont have abundant resources dont worry a wonderful church member recently told me i didnt raise my children on money i raised them on faith there is a great truth to that begin exercising your faith in every area of your life if you dont you will suffer what i would call faith atrophy the very strength needed to exercise your faith will be diminished so exercise your faith every day and you will wax stronger and stronger and firmer and firmer in the faith of christ14 to be ready for marriage make certain you are worthy to take the sacrament and hold a temple recommend go to the temple regularly serve in the church in addition to serving in church callings follow the example of the savior who simply went about doing good15 now you may have serious questions about the choices ahead in my young adult years i sought counsel from my parents and from faithful trusted advisers one was a priesthood leader another was a teacher who believed in me both said to me if you want my counsel be prepared to take it i understood what that meant prayerfully select mentors who have your spiritual wellbeing at heart be careful about taking advice from your peers if you want more than you now have reach up not across16 remember no one can reach upward on your behalf only your faith and prayers will cause you to lift yourself and have the mighty change of heart only your resolve to be obedient can change your life because of the saviors atoning sacrifice for you the power is in you17 you have your agency you have strong testimonies if you are obedient and you can follow the spirit that guides you recently a young filmmaker said he felt he was part of a generation of prodigalsa generation looking for hope and joy and fulfillment but looking in all the wrong places and in the wrong ways18 in the saviors parable of the prodigal son the son had many blessings awaiting him but before he could claim them he had to look closely at his life his choices and his circumstances the miracle that happened next is described in the scriptures with a simple phrase he came to himself19 may i encourage you to come to yourself in the church when important decisions must be made we often hold council meetings family councils serve a similar purpose you may want to conduct what ill call a personal council after praying spend some time alone think about what is ahead ask yourself what areas of my life do i want to strengthen so that i can strengthen others where do i want to be a year from now two years from now what choices do i need to make to get there just remember you are a pilot and you are in charge i testify that as you come to yourself your heavenly father will come to you by the comforting hand of his holy spirit he will help you along i bear my testimony that god lives i bear my special witness that the savior loves you shall we not go on in his great cause go forward and not backward20 as you follow him he will strengthen and uphold you he will bring you up to your highest home in the name of jesus christ
