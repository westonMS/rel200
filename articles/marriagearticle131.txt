voices of the past of the present of the future by president spencer w kimball acting president of the council of the twelve imagepresident spencer w kimball address delivered at general conference saturday morning april 3 1971 beloved brothers and sisters and friends i fully subscribe to all that president smith has just said and i testify that he is gods prophet upon the earth today history repeats itself and we need only return to the past to learn the solutions for the present and the future the corinthians seem to have been troubled by the same conflicting messages we hear in our own time paul told them for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle for ye shall speak into the air there are so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification 1 cor 14810 pauls was an impressive voice powerful and strong never silenced in all the interim centuries there are voices all about us some are harsh and raucous others sweet and penetrating pauls revelations included visions of these latter days his voice is saying in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats 1 tim 41 voices again rasping voices proclaiming doctrines of devils saying there is no sin there is no devil there is no god saying that we will eat drink and be merry like the antediluvians who never believed that the flood would really come many voices of seducing spirits advocate carnal pleasures and unrestrained physical satisfactions our world is now much the same as it was in the days of the nephite prophet who said if it were not for the prayers of the righteous ye would even now be visited with utter destruction alma 1022 of course there are many many upright and faithful who live all the commandments and whose lives and prayers keep the world from destruction we are living in the last days and they are precarious and frightening the shadows are deepening and the night creeps in to envelop us the clear voice of paul in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous blasphemers disobedient to parents unholy without natural affection incontinent lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god 2 tim 314 a prominent columnist wrote of our day one thing is certain we shall be given no centuries for a leisurely and comfortable decay we have an enemy nowremorseless crude brutal and cocky who believes that we are in an advanced state of moral decline and ripening for the kill jenkin lloyd jones human events november 24 1961 recently people on the street responded to the question is chastity outmoded the answers morals have changed virginity is on the way out love is in virgins are really weird there are few people these days who are virtuous one girl said chastity is outdated because in these enlightened days people are freer yes free to commit sin free to break laws free to contract vd free to shorten life free to deny god free to be free of all real freedoms we see our world sinking into depths of corruption every sin mentioned by paul is now rampant in our society men and women are lovers of their own selves they boast in their accomplishment they curse they blaspheme another sin is disobedience of children to parents and parents disobedience to law many are without the natural affection which seems to be eroding family life as they seek to satisfy their own selfish wants there are said to be millions of perverts who have relinquished their natural affection and bypassed courtship and normal marriage relationships this practice is spreading like a prairie fire and changing our world they are without natural affection for god for spouses and even for children paul speaks of continencea word almost forgotten by our world still in the dictionary it means selfrestraint in sexual activities especially many good people being influenced by the bold spirit of the times are now seeking surgery for the wife or the husband so they may avoid pregnancies and comply with the strident voice demanding a reduction of children it was never easy to bear and rear children but easy things do not make for growth and development but loud blatant voices today shout fewer children and offer the pill drugs surgery and even ugly abortion to accomplish that strange the proponents of depopulating the world seem never to have thought of continence libraries are loaded with books with shocking pictures showing people how to totally satisfy their animal natures but few books are found on the selfcontrol of continence with a theory that life is for sex every imagination of the minds of men devises ways to more completely get what they call sexual fulfillment which they demand at the expense of all elsefamily home eternal life there should be from press and lecture platform and pulpit deep and resounding voices urging man to rise above the carnal and rest his mind on things clean and sacred paul preached continence and selfmastery he practiced it being years in the mission field was that not his meaning when he said for i would that all men were even as i myself it is good for them if they abide even as i 1 cor 778 but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection 1 cor 927 paul speaks of lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god does that not describe the wanton sex permissiveness of our day paul speaks of those who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts 2 tim 36 immorality seems to now receive the wink of approval of the once honorable people debauchery never gave birth to good of any kind and paul said but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth 1 tim 56 but now comes a heavenly voice thou shalt not commit adultery and he that committeth adultery and repenteth not shall be cast out dc 4224 many voices loud and harsh come from among educators business and professional men sociologists psychologists authors movie actors legislators judges and others even some of the clergy who because they have learned a little about something seem to think they know all about everything this egotism and pride is prompted by the cunning father of lies hear the voice of a nephite prophet describing their acceptance of the cunning plan of the evil one to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of god 2 ne 929 when they are learned they think they are wise supposing they know of themselves wherefore their wisdom is foolishness and they shall perish 2 ne 928 peters voice was sure when he called the evil ones brute beasts who would perish in their own corruption he called them spots and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings having eyes full of adultery beguiling unstable souls he speaks of their lusts of the flesh through much wantonness and those who return to their sin after having been cleansed he likens to the dog returning to its vomit and the sow that has been washed returning to her wallowing again in the mire see 2 pet 21322 sustaining peter comes the voice of paul to titus unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled they profess that they know god but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate titus 11516 much has been said about the frustration of youth while we can hardly justify their eccentricities and disobedience and their apparent loss of faith perhaps part of the blame for their frustrations can be laid at the feet of those parents who gave them an example of disobeying both government and gods laws certainly some blame can be attached to the voices from lecture platforms editorial rooms or broadcasting stands and even from the pulpit such voices may have to answer for their perpetuating falsehood and their failure to give true leadership in combating evil as with the people so with the priest isa 242 the term priest is here used to denote all religious leaders of any faith isaiah said the earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof because they have transgressed the laws changed the ordinance broken the everlasting covenant isa 245 from among the discordant voices we are shocked at those of many priests who encourage the defilement of men and wink at the eroding trends and who deny the omniscience of god certainly these men should be holding firm yet some yield to popular clamor i give some quotes from the press many churchmen are reluctant to give a definite yes or no to marijuana it depends upon circumstances time august 16 1968 they have developed situation ethics which seem to cover all sins other religious leaders are saying precise rules of christian conduct should not necessarily apply to problems of sexuality londonbritish council of churches in contrast hear the strong voice of a prophet peter prophesied but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that brought them and many shall follow their pernicious ways 2 pet 212 only this month the press quoted the retired head of a populous church proposing revival of oldstyle betrothals which would permit young unmarried couples to sleep together with the churchs blessing and it would not be regarded in the moral sense as fornication and now the voice of a commentator recently the screen industry solemnly announced that henceforth perversion and homosexuality would no longer be barred from the screen we are drowning our youngsters in violence cynicism and sadism piped into the living room jenkins lloyd jones quoting from fairly recent publications the __________ church conference today approved recommendation that homosexuality between consenting adults should no longer be a criminal offense the voice from a muchread magazine a group of __________ ministers in san francisco thinks the churches ought to drop their strictures against homosexuals it was reported that groups of ministers and their wives attended a party given by homosexuals and lesbians to raise funds for the perversion program the magazine quoted that all bay area schools would have to close down immediately if all homosexuals currently working in the school systems were discovered and in keeping with state law dismissed newsweek february 13 1967 the minister quoted is reported to have said two people of the same sex can express love and deepen that love by sexual intercourse ibid those are ugly voicesthey are loud and raspy why do we speak in this vein why do we call to repentance when there are such pleasant subjects it is because someone must warn the world of its doom if life does not change directions we remember popes verse vice is a monster of so frightful mien as to be hated needs but to be seen yet seen too oft familiar with her face we first endure then pity then embrace alexander pope essay on man epistle ii line 135 some voices must cry out against them ours cannot remain silent to the great moses these perversions were an abomination and a defilement worthy of death to paul it was unnatural unmanly ungodly and a dishonorable passion of an adulterous nature and would close all the doors to the kingdom when parents are indiscriminate in their sex behavior and when writers authors religious leaders and others condone such transgression how can we save from the darkness the bewildered frustrated youth searching for an example a hitching post and something right in which to believea safe harbor the group that tolerates sexual anarchy is endangering its very survival says sociologist sorokin one prominent voice booms out that there are many steepled edifices in which the word sin has not been mentioned for a long time and a preachment against it cannot be remembered in direct contrast to the permissive voices above comes a voice of authority from the lords church man is a biological unit said president j reuben clark jr an animal but he is more than this he is the temple of an immortal spirit that spirit can be defiled by the flesh and defilement comes when the laws of chastity are violated our very civilization itself is based upon chastity the sanctity of marriage and the holiness of the home destroy these and christian man becomes a brute the family relationship continues through eternity it is the loftiest and most sacred human relationship we know conference report october 1938 p 137 the voice of the first presidency of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints in unmistakable terms warns sexual sinthe illicit sexual relations of men and womenstands in its enormity next to murder the lord has drawn no essential distinctions between fornication adultery and harlotry or prostitution each has fallen under his solemn and awful condemnation such cannot escape the punishments and the judgments which the lord has declared against this sin the day of reckoning will come just as certainly as night follows day then speaking of those who condone and justify evil whether from press or microphone or pulpit they continue they who would palliate this crime and say that such indulgence is but a sinless gratification of a normal desire like appeasing hunger and thirst speak filthiness with their lips their counsel leads to destruction their wisdom comes from the father of lies the message of the first presidency to the church improvement era november 1942 page 758 then comes the vibrant voice of paul again know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are 1 cor 31617 and the voice of deity i am jesus christ i command thee that thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife nor seek thy neighbors life dc 192425 sex involvement outside of marriage locks doors to temples and thus bars the way to eternal life we extend to every listener a cordial invitation to come to the watered garden to the shade of pleasant trees to the unchangeable truth come with us to sureness security consistency here the cooling waters flow the spring does not go dry come listen to a prophets voice and hear the word of god the lord does not change he is the same yesterday today and forever his church stands firm and unchangeable sin will not be tolerated but sincere repentance will be rewarded with forgiveness the lord who suffered for us says i command you to repent lest your sufferings be sorehow sore you know not how exquisite you know not yea how hard to bear you know not for behold i god have suffered these things for all that they might not suffer if they would repent but if they would not repent they must suffer even as i which suffering caused myself even god the greatest of all to tremble because of pain and to bleed at every pore dc 191518 may the voices of the lords servants prevail i pray in the name of jesus christ amen
