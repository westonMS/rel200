marriage is intended to be forever by elder james a cullimore assistant to the council of the twelve imageelder james a cullimore my beloved brethren and sisters as i stand before you here today i seek an interest in your faith and prayers as i deliver the things that i have in my heart marriage in the temple for time and eternity should be the goal of every member of the church for marriage is ordained of god marriage is a commandment marriage was instituted by divine edict the lord said and again verily i say unto you that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of god for marriage is ordained of god unto man wherefore it is lawful that he should have one wife and they twain shall be one flesh and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation and that it might be filled with the measure of man according to his creation before the world was made dc 491517 marriage is a sacred relationship entered into primarily for the rearing of a family in fulfillment of the commandments of the lord marriage with children and the beautiful family relationship which can come of it is the fulfillment of life if things were as they should be we would see a mother and father in a home having been married in the temple for time and eternity the father honoring his priesthood presiding in his home in righteousness father and mother loving each other and their children children loving and respecting each other and mother and father all actively engaged in their church responsibilities the lord intended that marriage performed for eternity in the temple should endure forever this was his plan president joseph fielding smith has said marriage as understood by latterday saints is a covenant ordained to be everlasting it is the foundation for eternal exaltation for without it there could be no eternal progress in the kingdom of god doctrines of salvation bookcraft 1967 vol 2 p 58 what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder mark 109 it is evident from the scriptures that marriage performed in the lords way should not be dissolved it is sad indeed to see how lightly some take their marriage vows there is great concern among the brethren as to the increasing number of divorces in the church today even though the divorce rate among members of the church is considerably less than the national rate and the rate of divorce among those married in the temple is less than with those married civilly yet the rate is alarmingly high divorce is usually the result of one or both not living the gospel i suppose this is the same reason divorce was finally permitted in the time of moses as referred to by the savior as he answered the pharisees when he said moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so matt 198 and so in our day members do not abide by the law of the gospel in its fullness and as in the day of moses divorce is permitted when deemed necessary although it was never intended to be if in marriage both parties would make gospel standards and principles the basis of their marriage few problems would arise they could not handle when one or the other or both begin to compromise gospel standards problems follow marriage is a sacred relationship and good members of the church would know that it is entered into primarily for the rearing of a family other important desires and plans in marriage should be well understood by both parties as well president mckay said in reference to the seriousness with which we enter the marriage contract to look upon marriage as a mere contract that may be entered into at pleasure in response to a romantic whim or for selfish purposes and severed at the first difficulty or misunderstanding that may arise is an evil meriting severe condemnation especially in cases wherein children are made to suffer because of such separation quoted in blaine r porter the latterday saint family deseret book co 1966 pp 402403 possibly to list some of the most common causes for which civil divorces are sought might be helpful in avoiding these problems incompatibility adultery money matters physical abuse dishonesty not living the gospel infidelity not honoring priesthood desertion constant bickering apathy drunkenness uncontrolled temper incompatibility has come to be such a common word it seems to be the justification for many problems im sure there are occasions where this is justified but what is incompatibility doesnt this indicate selfishness are we truly unselfish do we love our neighbor as ourself when we are not compatible have we made every effort to compromise our likes and dislikes with those of our spouse if we were truly living the gospel there would be much less incompatibility president mckay said of incompatibility for a couple who have basked in the sunshine of each others love to stand by daily and see the clouds of misunderstanding and discord obscure the lovelight of their lives is tragedy indeed in the darkness that follows the love sparkle in each others eyes is obscured to restore it fruitless attempts are made to say the right word and to do the right thing but the word and act are misinterpreted and angry retort reopens the wound and hearts once united become torn wider and wider asunder when this heartbreaking state is reached a separation is sought gospel ideals improvement era 1953 p 469 i have been shocked in learning the extent to which men are physically abusive to women in the october conference of 1951 president mckay said i cannot imagine a mans being cruel to a woman i cannot imagine her so conducting herself as to merit such treatment perhaps there are women in the world who exasperate their husbands but no man is justified in resorting to physical force or in exploding his feelings in profanity there are men undoubtedly in the world who are thus beastly but no man who holds the priesthood of god should so debase himself gospel ideals p 476 the matter of disinterest lack of voluntary expression lack of affection are common causes for breakdown of marriage president harold b lee recently said this to a group of priesthood leaders i say to you brethren the most dangerous thing that can happen between you and your wife or between me and my wife is apathy for them to feel that we are not interested in their affairs that we are not expressing our love and showing our affection in countless ways women to be happy have to be loved and so do men seminar for regional representatives of the twelve december 12 1970 p 6 to take lightly the law of chastity or to violate the moral teachings of the savior is a sober matter it seems incredible that priesthood holders and women who have been considered worthy to hold a recommend to the temple and be married therein are so often guilty of adultery infidelity and other sex sins in this day when so many women are working out of the home as men and women work together many homes are broken up by what at first starts to be an innocent association president mckay gave some sober direction to the men when he said a man who has entered into a sacred covenant in the house of the lord to remain true to the marriage vow is a traitor to the covenant if he separates himself from his wife and family just because he has permitted himself to become infatuated with the pretty face and comely form of some young girl who flattered him with a smile even though a loose interpretation of the law of the land would grant such a man a bill of divorcement i think he is unworthy of a recommend to have his second marriage performed in the temple gospel ideals p 473 no matter what the reason for divorce those usually hurt most are the children too often the children are robbed of the basic needs to prepare them for life president mckay said there are three fundamental things to which every child is entitled 1 a respected name 2 a sense of security 3 opportunities for development the lds family p 406 the possibility of any of these is lessened in divorce as sister cullimore and i went to the temple to be married president george h brimhall of brigham young university called us into his office he gave us some direction we have appreciated through the years he said the four fountains that will keep your garden of eden from becoming a desert are constant confidence constant counsel constant compromise constant courtship important to any marriage is complete confidencetrust in all things the confidence born of true love never doubting never questioning the integrity of each other someone has said society is built upon trust and trust upon confidence in one anothers integrity to counsel with each other and make decisions together is so important to a happy marriage counsel which includes the whole family might build good family relationships counseling with each other in all that is done will strengthen the bonds of marriage i suppose there is no surer need in marriage than constant compromise it is through compromise that we grow closer to each other as we acknowledge our own faults and recognize the virtues in the other and make the adjustments we strengthen our marriage henry watterson has said i would compromise war i would compromise glory i would compromise everything at that point where hate comes in where misery comes in where love ceases to be love and life begins its descent into the valley of the shadow of death but i would not compromise truth i would not compromise the right constant courtship president mckay has said the seeds of a happy married life are sown in youth happiness does not begin at the altar it begins during the period of youth and courtship pathways to happiness bookcraft 1957 p 49 neither should courtship end at the altar how important it is to constantly be conscious of our marriage and work at it every day we live keeping alive our courtship by kind acts thoughtfulness and consideration always archibald f bennett in his writings on family exaltation expresses this beautifully too many couples have come to the altar of marriage looking upon the marriage ceremony as the end of courtship instead of the beginning of an eternal courtship let us not forget that during the burdens of home life that tender words of appreciation courteous acts are even more appreciated than during those sweet days and months of courtship it is after the ceremony and during the trials that daily arise in the home that a word of thank you or pardon me if you please will contribute to that love which brought you to the altar the wedding ring gives no man the right to be cruel or inconsiderate and no woman the right to be slovenly cross or disagreeable the lds family p 236 may we keep sacred our marriage vows and live so that we might enjoy its eternal blessings i pray in the name of jesus christ amen
