a plea to my sisters by president russell m nelson president of the quorum of the twelve apostles imagepresident russell m nelson we need your strength your conversion your conviction your ability to lead your wisdom and your voices dear elders rasband stevenson and renlund we your brethren welcome you to the quorum of the twelve apostles we thank god for the revelations that he gives to his prophet president thomas s monson brothers and sisters when we met in general conference six months ago none of us anticipated the coming changes that would tug at the heartstrings of the entire church elder l tom perry delivered a powerful message about the irreplaceable role that marriage and family occupy in the lords plan we were stunned when just a few days later we learned of the cancer that would soon take him from us though president boyd k packers health had been declining he continued to soldier on in the work of the lord he was frail last april yet he was determined to declare his witness as long as he had breath then just 34 days after elder perrys passing president packer also stepped across the veil we missed elder richard g scott at our last general conference but weve reflected upon the powerful witness of the savior he had borne in many previous conferences and just 12 days ago elder scott was called home and reunited with his beloved jeanene i had the privilege of being with all of these brethren during their final days including joining members of president packers and elder scotts immediate families just before their passing it has been difficult for me to believe that these three treasured friends these magnificent servants of the lord are gone i miss them more than i can say as ive reflected on this unexpected turn of events one of the impressions that has lingered with me is that which i observed in these surviving wives etched in my mind are the serene images of sister donna smith packer and sister barbara dayton perry at their husbands bedsides both women filled with love truth and pure faith as sister packer sat next to her husband in his final hours she radiated that peace that passes all understanding1 though she realized that her beloved companion of almost 70 years would soon depart she showed the tranquility of a faithfilled woman she seemed angelic just as she was in this photo of them at the dedication of the brigham city utah temple imagepresident and sister packer at brigham city utah temple i saw that same kind of love and faith emanating from sister perry her devotion to both her husband and the lord was obvious and it moved me deeply imageelder and sister perry through their husbands final hours and continuing to the present day these stalwart women have shown the strength and courage that covenantkeeping women always demonstrate2 it would be impossible to measure the influence that such women have not only on families but also on the lords church as wives mothers and grandmothers as sisters and aunts as teachers and leaders and especially as exemplars and devout defenders of the faith3 this has been true in every gospel dispensation since the days of adam and eve yet the women of this dispensation are distinct from the women of any other because this dispensation is distinct from any other4 this distinction brings both privileges and responsibilities imageportrait of president kimball thirtysix years ago in 1979 president spencer w kimball made a profound prophecy about the impact that covenantkeeping women would have on the future of the lords church he prophesied much of the major growth that is coming to the church in the last days will come because many of the good women of the world will be drawn to the church in large numbers this will happen to the degree that the women of the church reflect righteousness and articulateness in their lives and to the degree that the women of the church are seen as distinct and differentin happy waysfrom the women of the world5 my dear sisters you who are our vital associates during this windingup scene the day that president kimball foresaw is today you are the women he foresaw your virtue light love knowledge courage character faith and righteous lives will draw good women of the world along with their families to the church in unprecedented numbers6 we your brethren need your strength your conversion your conviction your ability to lead your wisdom and your voices the kingdom of god is not and cannot be complete without women who make sacred covenants and then keep them women who can speak with the power and authority of god7 president packer declared we need women who are organized and women who can organize we need women with executive ability who can plan and direct and administer women who can teach women who can speak out we need women with the gift of discernment who can view the trends in the world and detect those that however popular are shallow or dangerous8 today let me add that we need women who know how to make important things happen by their faith and who are courageous defenders of morality and families in a sinsick world we need women who are devoted to shepherding gods children along the covenant path toward exaltation women who know how to receive personal revelation who understand the power and peace of the temple endowment women who know how to call upon the powers of heaven to protect and strengthen children and families women who teach fearlessly throughout my life i have been blessed by such women my departed wife dantzel was such a woman i will always be grateful for the lifechanging influence she had on me in all aspects of my life including my pioneering efforts in openheart surgery fiftyeight years ago i was asked to operate upon a little girl gravely ill from congenital heart disease her older brother had previously died of a similar condition her parents pleaded for help i was not optimistic about the outcome but vowed to do all in my power to save her life despite my best efforts the child died later the same parents brought another daughter to me then just 16 months old also born with a malformed heart again at their request i performed an operation this child also died this third heartbreaking loss in one family literally undid me i went home grief stricken i threw myself upon our living room floor and cried all night long dantzel stayed by my side listening as i repeatedly declared that i would never perform another heart operation then around 500 in the morning dantzel looked at me and lovingly asked are you finished crying then get dressed go back to the lab go to work you need to learn more if you quit now others will have to painfully learn what you already know oh how i needed my wifes vision grit and love i went back to work and learned more if it werent for dantzels inspired prodding i would not have pursued openheart surgery and would not have been prepared to do the operation in 1972 that saved the life of president spencer w kimball9 sisters do you realize the breadth and scope of your influence when you speak those things that come to your heart and mind as directed by the spirit a superb stake president told me of a stake council meeting in which they were wrestling with a difficult challenge at one point he realized that the stake primary president had not spoken so he asked if she had any impressions well actually i have she said and then proceeded to share a thought that changed the entire direction of the meeting the stake president continued as she spoke the spirit testified to me that she had given voice to the revelation we had been seeking as a council my dear sisters whatever your calling whatever your circumstances we need your impressions your insights and your inspiration we need you to speak up and speak out in ward and stake councils we need each married sister to speak as a contributing and full partner10 as you unite with your husband in governing your family married or single you sisters possess distinctive capabilities and special intuition you have received as gifts from god we brethren cannot duplicate your unique influence we know that the culminating act of all creation was the creation of woman11 we need your strength attacks against the church its doctrine and our way of life are going to increase because of this we need women who have a bedrock understanding of the doctrine of christ and who will use that understanding to teach and help raise a sinresistant generation12 we need women who can detect deception in all of its forms we need women who know how to access the power that god makes available to covenant keepers and who express their beliefs with confidence and charity we need women who have the courage and vision of our mother eve my dear sisters nothing is more crucial to your eternal life than your own conversion it is converted covenantkeeping womenwomen like my dear wife wendywhose righteous lives will increasingly stand out in a deteriorating world and who will thus be seen as different and distinct in the happiest of ways so today i plead with my sisters of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints to step forward take your rightful and needful place in your home in your community and in the kingdom of godmore than you ever have before i plead with you to fulfill president kimballs prophecy and i promise you in the name of jesus christ that as you do so the holy ghost will magnify your influence in an unprecedented way i bear witness of the reality of the lord jesus christ and of his redeeming atoning and sanctifying power and as one of his apostles i thank you my dear sisters and bless you to rise to your full stature to fulfill the measure of your creation as
