why marriage why family by elder d todd christofferson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder d todd christofferson a family built on the marriage of a man and woman supplies the best setting for gods plan to thrive above the great west door of the renowned westminster abbey in london england stand the statues of 10 christian martyrs of the 20th century included among them is dietrich bonhoeffer a brilliant german theologian born in 19061 bonhoeffer became a vocal critic of the nazi dictatorship and its treatment of jews and others he was imprisoned for his active opposition and finally executed in a concentration camp bonhoeffer was a prolific writer and some of his bestknown pieces are letters that sympathetic guards helped him smuggle out of prison later published as letters and papers from prison one of those letters was to his niece before her wedding it included these significant insights marriage is more than your love for each other in your love you see only your two selves in the world but in marriage you are a link in the chain of the generations which god causes to come and to pass away to his glory and calls into his kingdom in your love you see only the heaven of your own happiness but in marriage you are placed at a post of responsibility towards the world and mankind your love is your own private possession but marriage is more than something personalit is a status an office just as it is the crown and not merely the will to rule that makes the king so it is marriage and not merely your love for each other that joins you together in the sight of god and man so love comes from you but marriage from above from god2 in what way does marriage between a man and a woman transcend their love for one another and their own happiness to become a post of responsibility towards the world and mankind in what sense does it come from above from god to understand we have to go back to the beginning prophets have revealed that we first existed as intelligences and that we were given form or spirit bodies by god thus becoming his spirit childrensons and daughters of heavenly parents3 there came a time in this premortal existence of spirits when in furtherance of his desire that we could have a privilege to advance like himself4 our heavenly father prepared an enabling plan in the scriptures it is given various names including the plan of salvation5 the great plan of happiness6 and the plan of redemption7 the two principal purposes of the plan were explained to abraham in these words and there stood one among them that was like unto god and he said unto those who were with him we will go down for there is space there and we will take of these materials and we will make an earth whereon these spirits may dwell and we will prove them herewith to see if they will do all things whatsoever the lord their god shall command them and they who keep their first estate shall be added upon and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever8 thanks to our heavenly father we had already become spirit beings now he was offering us a path to complete or perfect that being the addition of the physical element is essential to the fulness of being and glory that god himself enjoys if while with god in the premortal spirit world we would agree to participate in his planor in other words keep our first estatewe would be added upon with a physical body as we came to dwell on the earth that he created for us if then in the course of our mortal experience we chose to do all things whatsoever the lord our god should command us we would have kept our second estate this means that by our choices we would demonstrate to god and to ourselves our commitment and capacity to live his celestial law while outside his presence and in a physical body with all its powers appetites and passions could we bridle the flesh so that it became the instrument rather than the master of the spirit could we be trusted both in time and eternity with godly powers including power to create life would we individually overcome evil those who did would have glory added upon their heads for ever and evera very significant aspect of that glory being a resurrected immortal and glorified physical body9 no wonder we shouted for joy at these magnificent possibilities and promises10 at least four things are needed for the success of this divine plan first was the creation of the earth as our dwelling place whatever the details of the creation process we know that it was not accidental but that it was directed by god the father and implemented by jesus christall things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made11 second is the condition of mortality adam and eve acted for all who had chosen to participate in the fathers great plan of happiness12 their fall created the conditions needed for our physical birth and for mortal experience and learning outside the presence of god with the fall came an awareness of good and evil and the godgiven power to choose13 finally the fall brought about physical death needed to make our time in mortality temporary so that we would not live forever in our sins14 third is redemption from the fall we see the role of death in our heavenly fathers plan but that plan would become void without some way to overcome death in the end both physical and spiritual thus a redeemer the only begotten son of god jesus christ suffered and died to atone for adam and eves transgression thereby providing resurrection and immortality for all and since none of us will have been perfectly and consistently obedient to the gospel law his atonement also redeems us from our own sins on condition of repentance with the saviors atoning grace providing forgiveness of sins and sanctification of the soul we can spiritually be born again and reconciled to god our spiritual deathour separation from godwill end15 fourth and finally is the setting for our physical birth and subsequent spiritual rebirth into the kingdom of god for his work to succeed to exalt us with himself16 god ordained that men and women should marry and give birth to children thereby creating in partnership with god the physical bodies that are key to the test of mortality and essential to eternal glory with him he also ordained that parents should establish families and rear their children in light and truth17 leading them to a hope in christ the father commands us teach these things freely unto your children saying that inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water and blood and the spirit which i have made and so became of dust a living soul even so ye must be born again into the kingdom of heaven of water and of the holy spirit and be cleansed by blood even the blood of mine only begotten that ye might be sanctified from all sin and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world and eternal life in the world to come even immortal glory18 knowing why we left the presence of our heavenly father and what it takes to return and be exalted with him it becomes very clear that nothing relative to our time on earth can be more important than physical birth and spiritual rebirth the two prerequisites of eternal life this is to use the words of dietrich bonhoeffer the office of marriage the post of responsibility towards mankind that this divine institution from above from god occupies it is the link in the chain of the generations both here and hereafterthe order of heaven a family built on the marriage of a man and woman supplies the best setting for gods plan to thrivethe setting for the birth of children who come in purity and innocence from god and the environment for the learning and preparation they will need for a successful mortal life and eternal life in the world to come a critical mass of families built on such marriages is vital for societies to survive and flourish that is why communities and nations generally have encouraged and protected marriage and the family as privileged institutions it has never been just about the love and happiness of adults the social science case for marriage and for families headed by a married man and woman is compelling19 and so we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals communities and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets20 but our claims for the role of marriage and family rest not on social science but on the truth that they are gods creation it is he who in the beginning created adam and eve in his image male and female and joined them as husband and wife to become one flesh and to multiply and replenish the earth21 each individual carries the divine image but it is in the matrimonial union of male and female as one that we attain perhaps the most complete meaning of our having been made in the image of godmale and female neither we nor any other mortal can alter this divine order of matrimony it is not a human invention such marriage is indeed from above from god and is as much a part of the plan of happiness as the fall and the atonement in the premortal world lucifer rebelled against god and his plan and his opposition only grows in intensity he fights to discourage marriage and the formation of families and where marriages and families are formed he does what he can to disrupt them he attacks everything that is sacred about human sexuality tearing it from the context of marriage with a seemingly infinite array of immoral thoughts and acts he seeks to convince men and women that marriage and family priorities can be ignored or abandoned or at least made subservient to careers other achievements and the quest for selffulfillment and individual autonomy certainly the adversary is pleased when parents neglect to teach and train their children to have faith in christ and be spiritually born again brothers and sisters many things are good many are important but only a few are essential to declare the fundamental truths relative to marriage and family is not to overlook or diminish the sacrifices and successes of those for whom the ideal is not a present reality some of you are denied the blessing of marriage for reasons including a lack of viable prospects samesex attraction physical or mental impairments or simply a fear of failure that for the moment at least overshadows faith or you may have married but that marriage ended and you are left to manage alone what two together can barely sustain some of you who are married cannot bear children despite overwhelming desires and pleading prayers even so everyone has gifts everyone has talents everyone can contribute to the unfolding of the divine plan in each generation much that is good much that is essentialeven sometimes all that is necessary for nowcan be achieved in less than ideal circumstances so many of you are doing your very best and when you who bear the heaviest burdens of mortality stand up in defense of gods plan to exalt his children we are all ready to march with confidence we testify that the atonement of jesus christ has anticipated and in the end will compensate all deprivation and loss for those who turn to him no one is predestined to receive less than all that the father has for his children one young mother recently confided to me her anxiety about being inadequate in this highest of callings i felt that the issues that concerned her were small and she neednt worry she was doing fine but i knew she only wanted to please god and to honor his trust i offered words of reassurance and in my heart i pleaded that god her heavenly father would buoy her up with his love and the witness of his approval as she is about his work that is my prayer for all of us today may we each find approval in his sight may marriages flourish and families prosper and whether our lot is a fulness of these blessings in mortality or not may the lords grace bring happiness now and faith in sure promises to come in the name of jesus christ amen notes see kevin rudd faith in politics the monthly oct 2006 themonthlycomaumonthlyessayskevinruddfaithpolitics300

statement the design of god before the foundation of the world was that we should take tabernacles bodies that through faithfulness we should overcome and thereby obtain a resurrection from the dead in this wise obtaining glory honor power and dominion the prophet also stated we came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before god in the celestial kingdom the great principle of happiness consists in having a body the devil has no body and herein is his punishment he is pleased when he can obtain the tabernacle of man and when cast out by the savior he asked to

peace of mind and joy in the holy ghost here and a fulness of joy and happiness at his right hand hereafter or to pursue an evil course going on in sin and rebellion against god thereby bringing condemnation to their souls in this world and an eternal loss in the world to come the prophet also noted satan cannot seduce us by his enticements unless we in our hearts consent and yield our

twoparent family environment but on average and in the majority of cases evidence of the social benefits of marriage and of the comparatively superior outcomes for children in families headed by a married man and woman is extensive on the other hand the social and economic costs of what one commentator calls the global flight from the family weigh increasingly on society nicholas eberstadt catalogs the worldwide declines in marriage and childbearing and the trends regarding fatherless homes and divorce and observes the deleterious impact on the hardly inconsequential numbers of children disadvantaged by the flight from the family is already plain enough so too the damaging role of divorce and outofwedlock childbearing in exacerbating income disparities and wealth gapsfor society as a whole but especially for children yes children are resilient and all that but the flight from family most assuredly comes at the expense of the vulnerable young that same flight also has unforgiving
