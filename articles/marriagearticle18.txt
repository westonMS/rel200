the greatest generation of young adults by elder m russell ballard of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder m russell ballard what we need now is the greatest generation of young adults in the history of the church we need your whole heart and soul one of the great pleasures i enjoy as i travel throughout the world is the opportunity to meet and greet our missionaries these great elders and sisters radiate the light of christ and i am always inspired by their love for the lord jesus christ and their devoted service to him every time i shake hands with them and feel of their remarkable spirit and faith i say to myself these wonderful sons and daughters of ours are truly a miracle during the october 2002 general priesthood meeting i challenged bishops parents and prospective missionaries to raise the bar for fulltime missionary service i then said that what we need is the greatest generation of missionaries in the history of the church we need worthy qualified spiritually energized missionaries we need your whole heart and soul we need vibrant thinking passionate missionaries who know how to listen to and respond to the whisperings of the holy spirit1 in many ways the world today is more challenging than it was 13 years ago our young men and young women have many more distractions to sidetrack them in their preparations for both a mission and a future happy life technology has expanded and almost everyone has access to handheld devices that can capture the attention of the human family of god for both great good and unconscionable ill tonight i speak to missionaries now serving future missionaries returned missionaries and all young adult men in the church i pray you will understand and thoughtfully consider what i have to say to you as you journey through these exciting and exacting years of your life in the early days of the church missionaries were interviewed by a general authority before they went on their missions these days you are interviewed to serve as missionaries by your bishops and stake presidents and most of you will go through your entire lives without being interviewed by a general authority that is simply a reflection of the reality in a worldwide church of more than 15 million members i know i speak for my brethren when i tell you that we wish it were possible for us to know all of you personally and to be able to tell you that we love you and that we support you fortunately the lord has provided ways for us to reach out to you for example a member of the quorum of the twelve assigns every missionary to his or her mission although this is done without a traditional facetoface interview technology and revelation combine to provide an experience that is remarkably intimate and personal let me tell you how this happens your photograph comes up on a computer screen together with key information provided by your bishop and stake president when your picture appears we look into your eyes and review your answers to the missionary recommendation questions for that brief moment it seems as if you are present and responding to us directly as we look at your photograph we trust that you have cleared in every way the raised bar required today to be a faithful successful missionary then by the power of the spirit of the lord and under the direction of president thomas s monson we assign you to one of the churchs 406 worldwide missions no it isnt the same as a personal facetoface interview but its close videoconferencing is another way that helps us reach out to church leaders and members who live far away from church headquarters with that in mind i would like those of you preparing to serve missions those who have returned and all of you young adults to spend a few minutes with me as though we were having a personal video chat right now please look at me for a few minutes as though you and i were the only ones in the room wherever you are tonight for my part i will imagine that i am looking into your eyes and listening carefully to your responses to a few questions that i believe will tell me a lot about the depth of your testimony and your devotion to god if i may paraphrase what i said to missionaries 13 years ago what we need now is the greatest generation of young adults in the history of the church we need your whole heart and soul we need vibrant thinking passionate young adults who know how to listen and respond to the whisperings of the holy spirit as you make your way through the daily trials and temptations of being a young contemporary latterday saint in other words its time to raise the bar not only for missionaries but also for returned missionaries and for your entire generation to that end please ponder in your heart your answers to these questions do you search the scriptures regularly do you kneel in prayer to talk with your heavenly father each morning and each night do you fast and donate a fast offering each montheven if you are a poor struggling student who cant afford to donate much do you think deeply about the savior and his atoning sacrifice for you when you are asked to prepare bless pass or partake of the sacrament do you attend your meetings and strive to keep the sabbath day holy are you honest at home school church and work are you mentally and spiritually clean do you avoid viewing pornography or looking at websites magazines movies or apps including tinder and snapchat photos that would embarrass you if your parents church leaders or the savior himself saw you are you careful with your timeavoiding inappropriate technology and social media including video games which can dull your spiritual sensitivity is there anything in your life you need to change and fix beginning tonight thank you for this short personal visit i hope you answered each one of these questions honestly and thoughtfully if you find yourself lacking in any of these simple principles then i urge you to courageously repent and bring your life back in line with gospel standards of righteous discipleship now brethren may i offer additional counsel that will help you get your testimony of the gospel deep in your hearts and your souls i remind you returned missionaries that your preparation for life and for a family should be continuous rm doesnt mean retired mormon as a returned missionary you should be anxiously engaged in a good cause and do many things of your own free will and bring to pass much righteousness2 please use the skills you learned on your mission to bless the lives of people around you every day do not shift your focus from serving others to focusing exclusively on school work or social activities instead balance your life with spiritual experiences that remind and prepare you for continued daily ministering to others during your missions you learned the importance of visiting people in their homes i would hope that all of our young adults whether or not you served fulltime missions understand the importance of visiting with people who are lonely sick or discouragednot only as an assignment but also because of the genuine love you have for heavenly father and his children those of you in high school preparing for missions i encourage you to participate in and graduate from seminary you young adults should enroll in an institute of religion3 if you are attending a church school consistently include a class each semester in religious education during this important season of preparation for a mission eternal marriage and life as an adult you must continue to find ways to learn and grow and receive inspiration and guidance through the holy ghost a careful prayerful study of the gospel through seminary institute or religious education classes can assist you in that goal whether you attend a church school or not whether you attend college or not do not think that you are too busy to study the gospel seminary institute or religion classes will provide balance to your life and add to your secular education by giving you another opportunity to spend time studying the scriptures and the teachings of the prophets and apostles there are four outstanding new courses that i would encourage every young adult to look into and to attend4 and dont forget that classes and activities offered at your local institute or through your young single adult ward or stake will also be a place where you can be with other young men and young women and lift and inspire one another as you learn and grow spiritually and socialize together brethren if you will set aside your cell phone and actually look around a little you may even find your future companion at the institute which leads me to another bit of counsel that im sure you knew was coming you single adults need to date and marry please stop delaying i know some of you fear family formation however if you marry the right person at the right time and in the right place you need not fear in fact many problems you encounter will be avoided if you are anxiously engaged in righteous dating courting and marriage dont text her use your own voice to introduce yourself to the righteous daughters of god who are all around you to actually hear a human voice will shock herperhaps into saying yes now brethren i testify to you that the lord jesus christ can help us fix anything that needs fixing in our lives through his atoning sacrifice this evening as we prepare to celebrate easter sunday tomorrow please pause with me to remember the gift of christs atonement remember that our heavenly father and our savior jesus christ know you best and love you the most through the atonement the redeemer took upon himself our troubles pains and sins the savior of the world came to understand each of us individually by experiencing our dashed hopes challenges and tragedies through his suffering in gethsemane and on the cross5 he died as one final act of love for us and was buried in a new tomb on that fateful night on sunday morning jesus rose from the deadpromising new life for each of us the risen lord then commissioned his disciples to teach everyone to have faith in christ repent of sin be baptized receive the gift of the holy ghost and endure to the end brethren we know that god our father and his beloved son appeared to the prophet joseph smith and restored through him the fulness of the everlasting gospel of jesus christ be strong brethren keep the commandments of god the lord jesus christ promises that all things we desire to do in righteousness will be ours church leaders are counting on you we need every one of you young adults to prepare to marry to serve and to lead in the days ahead for which i humbly pray in the name of the lord jesus christ
