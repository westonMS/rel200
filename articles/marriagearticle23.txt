no other gods by elder dallin h oaks of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder dallin h oaks are we serving priorities or gods ahead of the god we profess to worship the ten commandments are fundamental to the christian and jewish faiths given by god to the children of israel through the prophet moses the first two of these commandments direct our worship and our priorities in the first the lord commanded thou shalt have no other gods before me exodus 203 centuries later when jesus was asked which is the great commandment in the law he answered thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind matthew 223637 the second of the ten commandments elaborates the direction to have no other gods and identifies what should be the ultimate priority in our lives as his children thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing in the heavens or the earth exodus 204 the commandment then adds thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them exodus 205 more than merely forbidding physical idols this states a fundamental priority for all time jehovah explains for i the lord thy god am a jealous god shewing mercy unto them that love me and keep my commandments exodus 2056 the meaning of jealous is revealing its hebrew origin means possessing sensitive and deep feelings exodus 205 footnote b thus we offend god when we serve other godswhen we have other first priorities1 i what other priorities are being served ahead of god by personseven religious personsin our day consider these possibilities all common in our world cultural and family traditions political correctness career aspirations material possessions recreational pursuits power prominence and prestige if none of these examples seems to apply to any one of us we can probably suggest others that do the principle is more important than individual examples the principle is not whether we have other priorities the question posed by the second commandment is what is our ultimate priority are we serving priorities or gods ahead of the god we profess to worship have we forgotten to follow the savior who taught that if we love him we will keep his commandments see john 1415 if so our priorities have been turned upside down by the spiritual apathy and undisciplined appetites so common in our day ii for latterday saints gods commandments are based on and inseparable from gods plan for his childrenthe great plan of salvation this plan sometimes called the great plan of happiness alma 428 explains our origin and destiny as children of godwhere we came from why we are here and where we are going the plan of salvation explains the purpose of creation and the conditions of mortality including gods commandments the need for a savior and the vital role of mortal and eternal families if we latterday saints who have been given this knowledge do not establish our priorities in accord with this plan we are in danger of serving other gods knowledge of gods plan for his children gives latterday saints a unique perspective on marriage and family we are correctly known as a familycentered church our theology begins with heavenly parents and our highest aspiration is to attain the fulness of eternal exaltation we know this is possible only in a family relationship we know that the marriage of a man and a woman is necessary for the accomplishment of gods plan only this marriage will provide the approved setting for mortal birth and to prepare family members for eternal life we look on marriage and the bearing and nurturing of children as part of gods plan and a sacred duty of those given the opportunity to do so we believe that the ultimate treasures on earth and in heaven are our children and our posterity iii because of what we understand about the potentially eternal role of the family we grieve at the sharply declining numbers of births and marriages in many western countries whose historic cultures are christian and jewish responsible sources report the following the united states now has the lowest birthrate in its history2 and in many european union nations and other developed countries birthrates are below the level necessary to maintain their populations3 this threatens the survival of cultures and even of nations in america the percentage of young adults ages 18 to 29 who are married fell from 59 percent in 1960 to 20 percent by 20104 the median age for first marriage is now at its highest level in history 26 for women and almost 29 for men5 in many countries and cultures 1 the traditional family of a married mother and father and children is coming to be the exception rather than the rule 2 the pursuit of a career instead of marriage and the bearing of children is an increasing choice of many young women and 3 the role and perceived necessity of fathers is diminishing in the midst of these concerning trends we are also conscious that gods plan is for all of his children and that god loves all of his children everywhere6 the first chapter of the book of mormon declares that gods power and goodness and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth 1 nephi 114 a later chapter declares that he hath given his salvation free for all men and that all men are privileged the one like unto the other and none are forbidden 2 nephi 262728 consequently the scriptures teach that we are responsible to be compassionate and charitable loving toward all men see 1 thessalonians 312 1 john 317 dc 12145 iv we are also respectful of the religious beliefs of all people even of those increasing numbers who profess no belief in god we know that through the godgiven power of choice many will hold beliefs contrary to ours but we are hopeful that others will be equally respectful of our religious beliefs and understand that our beliefs compel us to some different choices and behaviors than theirs for example we believe that as an essential part of his plan of salvation god has established an eternal standard that sexual relations should occur only between a man and a woman who are married the power to create mortal life is the most exalted power god has given to his children its use was mandated by gods first commandment to adam and eve see genesis 128 but other important commandments were given to forbid its misuse see exodus 2014 1 thessalonians 43 the emphasis we place on the law of chastity is explained by our understanding of the purpose of our procreative powers in the accomplishment of gods plan outside the bonds of marriage between a man and a woman all uses of our procreative powers are to one degree or another sinful and contrary to gods plan for the exaltation of his children the importance we attach to the law of chastity explains our commitment to the pattern of marriage that originated with adam and eve and has continued through the ages as gods pattern for the procreative relationship between his sons and daughters and for the nurturing of his children fortunately many persons affiliated with other denominations or organizations agree with us on the nature and importance of marriage some on the basis of religious doctrine and others on the basis of what they deem best for society our knowledge of gods plan for his children7 explains why we are distressed that more and more children are born outside of marriagecurrently 41 percent of all births in the united states8and that the number of couples living together without marriage has increased dramatically in the past half century five decades ago only a tiny percentage of first marriages were preceded by cohabitation now cohabitation precedes 60 percent of marriages9 and this is increasingly accepted especially among teenagers recent survey data found about 50 percent of teenagers stating that outofwedlock childbearing was a worthwhile lifestyle10 v there are many political and social pressures for legal and policy changes to establish behaviors contrary to gods decrees about sexual morality and contrary to the eternal nature and purposes of marriage and childbearing these pressures have already authorized samegender marriages in various states and nations other pressures would confuse gender or homogenize those differences between men and women that are essential to accomplish gods great plan of happiness our understanding of gods plan and his doctrine gives us an eternal perspective that does not allow us to condone such behaviors or to find justification in the laws that permit them and unlike other organizations that can change their policies and even their doctrines our policies are determined by the truths god has identified as unchangeable our twelfth article of faith states our belief in being subject to civil authority and in obeying honoring and sustaining the law but mans laws cannot make moral what god has declared immoral commitment to our highest priorityto love and serve godrequires that we look to his law for our standard of behavior for example we remain under divine command not to commit adultery or fornication even when those acts are no longer crimes under the laws of the states or countries where we reside similarly laws legalizing socalled samesex marriage do not change gods law of marriage or his commandments and our standards concerning it we remain under covenant to love god and keep his commandments and to refrain from serving other gods and prioritieseven those becoming popular in our particular time and place in this determination we may be misunderstood and we may incur accusations of bigotry suffer discrimination or have to withstand invasions of our free exercise of religion if so i think we should remember our first priorityto serve godand like our pioneer predecessors push our personal handcarts forward with the same fortitude they exhibited a teaching of president thomas s monson applies to this circumstance at this conference 27 years ago he boldly declared let us have the courage to defy the consensus the courage to stand for principle courage not compromise brings the smile of gods approval courage becomes a living and an attractive virtue when it is regarded not only as a willingness to die manfully but as the determination to live decently a moral coward is one who is afraid to do what he thinks is right because others will disapprove or laugh remember that all men have their fears but those who face their fears with dignity have courage as well11 i pray that we will not let the temporary challenges of mortality cause us to forget the great commandments and priorities we have been given by our creator and our savior we must not set our hearts so much on the things of the world and aspire to the honors of men see dc 12135 that we stop trying to achieve our eternal destiny we who know gods plan for his childrenwe who have made covenants to participate in ithave a clear responsibility we must never deviate from our paramount desire which is to achieve eternal life12 we must never dilute our first priorityto have no other gods and to serve no other priorities ahead of god the father and his son our savior jesus christ may god help us to understand this priority and to be understood by others as we seek to pursue it in a wise and loving way i pray in the name of jesus christ amen notes
