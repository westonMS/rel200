decisions for eternity by elder russell m nelson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder russell m nelson the wise use of your freedom to make your own decisions is crucial to your spiritual growth now and for eternity my dear brothers and sisters each day is a day of decision president thomas s monson has taught us that decisions determine destiny1 the wise use of your freedom to make your own decisions is crucial to your spiritual growth now and for eternity you are never too young to learn never too old to change your yearnings to learn and change come from a divinely instilled striving for eternal progression2 each day brings opportunity for decisions for eternity we are eternal beingsspirit children of heavenly parents the bible records that god created man in his own image male and female created he them3 recently i heard a chorus of children sing the beloved song i am a child of god4 i wondered why havent i heard that song rendered more often by singing mothers or faithful fathers are we not all children of god in truth not one of us can ever stop being a child of god as children of god we should love him with all our heart and soul even more than we love our earthly parents5 we should love our neighbors as brothers and sisters no other commandments are greater than these6 and we should ever revere the worth of human life through each of its many stages scripture teaches that the body and the spirit are the soul of man7 as a dual being each of you can thank god for his priceless gifts of your body and your spirit the human body my professional years as a medical doctor gave me a profound respect for the human body created by god as a gift to you it is absolutely amazing think of your eyes that see ears that hear and fingers that feel all the wondrous things around you your brain lets you learn think and reason your heart pumps tirelessly day and night almost without your awareness8 your body protects itself pain comes as a warning that something is wrong and needs attention infectious illnesses strike from time to time and when they do antibodies are formed that increase your resistence to subsequent infection your body repairs itself cuts and bruises heal broken bones can become strong once again i have cited but a tiny sample of the many amazing godgiven qualities of your body even so it seems that in every family if not in every person some physical conditions exist that require special care9 a pattern for coping with such a challenge has been given by the lord he said i give unto men weakness that they may be humble for if they humble themselves and have faith in me then will i make weak things become strong unto them10 stellar spirits are often housed in imperfect bodies11 the gift of such a body can actually strengthen a family as parents and siblings willingly build their lives around that child born with special needs the aging process is also a gift from god as is death the eventual death of your mortal body is essential to gods great plan of happiness12 why because death will allow your spirit to return home to him13 from an eternal perspective death is only premature for those who are not prepared to meet god with your body being such a vital part of gods eternal plan it is little wonder that the apostle paul described it as a temple of god14 each time you look in the mirror see your body as your temple that truthrefreshed gratefully each daycan positively influence your decisions about how you will care for your body and how you will use it and those decisions will determine your destiny how could this be because your body is the temple for your spirit and how you use your body affects your spirit some of the decisions that will determine your eternal destiny include how will you choose to care for and use your body what spiritual attributes will you choose to develop the human spirit your spirit is an eternal entity the lord said to his prophet abraham thou wast chosen before thou wast born15 the lord said something similar about jeremiah16 and many others17 he even said it about you18 your heavenly father has known you for a very long time you as his son or daughter were chosen by him to come to earth at this precise time to be a leader in his great work on earth19 you were chosen not for your bodily characteristics but for your spiritual attributes such as bravery courage integrity of heart a thirst for truth a hunger for wisdom and a desire to serve others you developed some of these attributes premortally others you can develop here on earth20 as you persistently seek them21 a pivotal spiritual attribute is that of selfmasterythe strength to place reason over appetite selfmastery builds a strong conscience and your conscience determines your moral responses in difficult tempting and trying situations fasting helps your spirit to develop dominance over your physical appetites fasting also increases your access to heavens help as it intensifies your prayers why the need for selfmastery god implanted strong appetites within us for nourishment and love vital for the human family to be perpetuated22 when we master our appetites within the bounds of gods laws we can enjoy longer life greater love and consummate joy23 it is not surprising then that most temptations to stray from gods plan of happiness come through the misuse of those essential godgiven appetites controlling our appetites is not always easy not one of us manages them perfectly24 mistakes happen errors are made sins are committed what can we do then we can learn from them and we can truly repent25 we can change our behavior our very desires can change how there is only one way true changepermanent changecan come only through the healing cleansing and enabling power of the atonement of jesus christ26 he loves youeach of you27 he allows you to access his power as you keep his commandments eagerly earnestly and exactly it is that simple and certain the gospel of jesus christ is a gospel of change28 a strong human spirit with control over appetites of the flesh is master over emotions and passions and not a slave to them that kind of freedom is as vital to the spirit as oxygen is to the body freedom from selfslavery is true liberation29 we are free to choose liberty and eternal life or to choose captivity and death30 when we choose the loftier path toward liberty and eternal life that path includes marriage31 latterday saints proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of god and that the family is central to the creators plan for the eternal destiny of his children we also know that gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose32 marriage between a man and a woman is fundamental to the lords doctrine and crucial to gods eternal plan marriage between a man and a woman is gods pattern for a fulness of life on earth and in heaven gods marriage pattern cannot be abused misunderstood or misconstrued33 not if you want true joy gods marriage pattern protects the sacred power of procreation and the joy of true marital intimacy34 we know that adam and eve were married by god before they ever experienced the joy of uniting as husband and wife35 in our day civil governments have a vested interest in protecting marriage because strong families constitute the best way of providing for the health education welfare and prosperity of rising generations36 but civil governments are heavily influenced by social trends and secular philosophies as they write rewrite and enforce laws regardless of what civil legislation may be enacted the doctrine of the lord regarding marriage and morality cannot be changed37 remember sin even if legalized by man is still sin in the eyes of god while we are to emulate our saviors kindness and compassion while we are to value the rights and feelings of all of gods children we cannot change his doctrine it is not ours to change his doctrine is ours to study understand and uphold the saviors way of life is good his way includes chastity before marriage and total fidelity within marriage38 the lords way is the only way for us to experience enduring happiness his way brings sustained comfort to our souls and perennial peace to our homes and best of all his way leads us home to him and our heavenly father to eternal life and exaltation39 this is the very essence of gods work and glory40 my dear brothers and sisters each day is a day of decision and our decisions determine our destiny one day each of us will stand before the lord in judgment41 we will each have a personal interview with jesus christ42 we will account for decisions that we made about our bodies our spiritual attributes and how we honored gods pattern for marriage and family that we may choose wisely each days decisions for eternity is my earnest prayer in the sacred name of jesus christ amen notes thomas s monson

potassium and calcium and compounds like water glucose and proteins are essential for survival the body deals with gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide it makes hormones like insulin adrenalin and thyroxin levels of each of these and many other constituents in the body are autoregulated within certain bounds servoregulatory relationships exist between glands of the body for example the pituitary gland at the base of the brain emits a hormone to stimulate the cortex of the adrenal glands to produce adrenal cortical hormones rising levels of cortical hormones in turn suppress the pituitarys output of the stimulating hormone and vice versa your body temperature is maintained at a normal range of 986f or 37c whether youre at the equator or at the north pole some conditions are easily evident others are latent some are familial others are not some people are predisposed to cancer others have allergies and so on each of us can be alert to his or her own area of weakness and humbly learn what the lord would teach that the weakness may become a strength ether 1227 some conditions wont be fully corrected until the resurrection when all things shall be restored to their
