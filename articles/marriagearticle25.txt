the home the school of life by elder enrique r falabella of the seventy imageelder enrique r falabella lessons are learned in a homethe place that can become a piece of heaven here on earth some parents excuse themselves for mistakes they have made at home stating that the reason for this is that there is not a school for parenting in reality such a school does exist and it can be the best of all this school is called home as i travel back to the past on the wings of my memory i recall cherished moments i have experienced with my wife as i share these memories with you you may recall experiences of your ownboth happy and sad we learn from them all 1 the temple is the place when i returned from my mission i met a beautiful young woman with long black hair down to her waist she had beautiful big honey eyes and a contagious smile she captivated me from the first moment i saw her my wife had set the goal to get married in the temple although back then the nearest temple required a trip of over 4000 miles 6400 km our civil marriage ceremony was both happy and sad for we were married with an expiration date the officer pronounced the words and now i declare you husband and wife but immediately after he said until death do you part so with sacrifice we set out to purchase a oneway ticket to the mesa arizona temple in the temple as we were kneeling down at the altar an authorized servant pronounced the words i longed for which declared us husband and wife for time and for all eternity a friend took us to sunday school during the meeting he stood up and introduced us to the class as the meeting came to a close a brother approached me and shook my hand leaving a 20dollar bill in it soon after another brother reached out to me as well and to my surprise he also left a bill in my hand i quickly looked for my wife who was across the room and shouted blanquy shake hands with everyone soon we had gathered enough money to return to guatemala in the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees and in order to obtain the highest a man must enter into this order of the priesthood1 2 to contend you need two people one of my wifes mottoes has been in order to contend you need two people and i will never be one of them the lord has clearly described the attributes which should guide our dealings with other people these are persuasion longsuffering gentleness meekness and love unfeigned2 physical abuse in the family is a practice that is occurring less often in certain societies and we rejoice in that however we are still far from eliminating emotional abuse the harm caused by this form of abuse dwells in our memory it wounds our personality it sows hatred in our hearts it lowers our selfesteem and it fills us with fear participating in the ceremony of celestial marriage is not enough we also have to live a celestial life 3 a child who sings is a happy child this is another motto my wife mentions frequently the savior understood the importance of sacred music after he observed passover with his disciples the scriptures relate and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives3 and speaking through the prophet joseph he said for my soul delighteth in the song of the heart yea the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads4 how touching it is to hear the song of a little one who has been taught by his or her parents to sing i am a child of god5 4 i need you to hug me the words i love you thank you very much and forgive me are like a balm for the soul they transform tears into happiness they provide comfort to the weigheddown soul and they confirm the tender feelings of our heart just as plants wither with the lack of precious water our love languishes and dies as we put to rest the words and acts of love i remember the days when we used to send love letters through standard post or how we collected a few coins to call our loved ones from a phone booth or how we would draw and write love poems on plain paper today all of this sounds like museum material technology in this day and age allows us to do wonders how easy it is to send a text message of love and gratitude youth do it all the time i wonder if this and other beautiful practices continue once our home is established one of the recent text messages i received from my wife reads like this a hug like heaven a kiss like the sun and an evening like the moon happy day i love you i cannot resist feeling like i am in heaven when i get a message like this our father in heaven is a perfect example of expressing love as he presented his son he used the words this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased6 5 i love the book of mormon and my savior jesus christ i am filled with emotion when i see my wife read the book of mormon every day as she does so i can feel her testimony just by seeing the joy in her countenance as she reads over the passages that testify of the mission of the savior how wise are the words of our savior search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me7 inspired by this i asked my grandchild raquel who had recently learned how to read what would you say about setting a goal to read the book of mormon her answer was but grandpa its so hard its a big book then i asked her to read me a page i took out a stopwatch and timed her i said you took only three minutes and the spanish version of the book of mormon has 642 pages so you need 1926 minutes this could have scared her even more so i divided that number by 60 minutes and told her she would need only 32 hours to read itless than a day and a half then she said to me thats so easy grandpa in the end raquel her brother esteban and our other grandchildren took more time than this because this is a book which needs to be read with a spirit of prayer and meditation with time as we learn to delight in the scriptures we shall exclaim as the psalmist how sweet are thy words unto my taste yea sweeter than honey to my mouth8 6 it is not enough to know the scriptures we have to live them i remember when i was a returned missionary and having searched the scriptures diligently i thought i knew it all during our courtship blanquy and i would study the scriptures together i used many of my notes and references to share my knowledge of the gospel with her after we married i came to a serious realization as i learned a great lesson from her i may have tried to teach her the gospel but she taught me how to live it when the savior concluded the sermon on the mount he gave this wise counsel therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock9 those who live the celestial principles found in the scriptures give comfort to those who suffer they bring joy to those who are depressed direction to those who are lost peace to those who are distressed and a sure guidance to those who seek the truth in summary the temple is the place to contend you need two people and i will never be one of them a child who sings is a happy child i need you to hug me i love the book of mormon and my savior jesus christ it is not enough to know the scriptures we have to live them these and many other lessons are learned in a homethe place that can become a piece of heaven here on earth10 i testify that the gospel of jesus christ and the plan of our heavenly father provide a sure direction in this life and the promise of eternal life in the name of jesus
