marriage watch and learn by elder l whitney clayton of the presidency of the seventy imageelder l whitney clayton the promises of the lord are extended to all those who follow the pattern of life that builds happy holy marriage relationships one evening several years ago my wife and i were visiting the home of one of our sons and his wife and children for dinner it was a typical event for a family with small children there was much noise and even more fun shortly after dinner our fouryearold granddaughter anna and i were still sitting at the table realizing that she had my full attention she stood up straight on a bench and fixed her eyes on me when she was sure that i was looking at her she solemnly ordered me to watch and learn she then danced and sang a song for me annas instruction to watch and learn was wisdom from the mouth of a babe we can learn so much by watching and then considering what we have seen and felt in that spirit let me share with you a few principles i have observed by watching and learning from wonderful faithful marriages these principles build strong satisfying marriages that are compatible with heavenly principles i invite you to watch and learn with me first i have observed that in the happiest marriages both the husband and wife consider their relationship to be a pearl beyond price a treasure of infinite worth they both leave their fathers and mothers and set out together to build a marriage that will prosper for eternity they understand that they walk a divinely ordained path they know that no other relationship of any kind can bring as much joy generate as much good or produce as much personal refinement watch and learn the best marriage partners regard their marriages as priceless next faith successful eternal marriages are built on the foundation of faith in the lord jesus christ and adherence to his teachings1 i have observed that couples who have made their marriages priceless practice the patterns of faith they attend sacrament and other meetings every week hold family home evening pray and study the scriptures together and as individuals and pay an honest tithing their mutual quest is to be obedient and good they do not consider the commandments to be a buffet from which they can pick and choose only the most appealing offerings faith is the foundation of every virtue that strengthens marriage strengthening faith strengthens marriage faith grows as we keep the commandments and so do the harmony and joy in marriage thus keeping the commandments is fundamental to establishing strong eternal marriages watch and learn faith in the lord jesus christ is the foundation of happy eternal marriages third repentance i have learned that happy marriages rely on the gift of repentance it is an essential element in every good marital relationship spouses who regularly conduct honest selfexamination and promptly take needed steps to repent and improve experience a healing balm in their marriages repentance helps restore and maintain harmony and peace humility is the essence of repentance humility is selfless not selfish it doesnt demand its own way or speak with moral superiority instead humility answers softly2 and listens kindly for understanding not vindication humility recognizes that no one can change someone else but with faith effort and the help of god we can undergo our own mighty change of heart3 experiencing the mighty change of heart causes us to treat others especially our spouses with meekness4 humility means that both husbands and wives seek to bless help and lift each other putting the other first in every decision watch and learn repentance and humility build happy marriages fourth respect i have observed that in wonderful happy marriages husbands and wives treat each other as equal partners practices from any place or any time in which husbands have dominated wives or treated them in any way as secondclass partners in marriage are not in keeping with divine law and should be replaced by correct principles and patterns of behavior husbands and wives in great marriages make decisions unanimously with each of them acting as a full participant and entitled to an equal voice and vote5 they focus first on the home and on helping each other with their shared responsibilities6 their marriages are based on cooperation not negotiation their dinner hour and the family time that follows become the center of their day and the object of their best efforts they turn off electronics and forgo personal entertainment in order to help with household duties to the extent possible they read with their children every night and both participate in putting the little ones to bed they retire to their bed together as their duties and circumstances permit husbands and wives work side by side in doing the most important work there isthe work we do in our own homes where there is respect there is also transparency which is a key element of happy marriages there are no secrets about relevant matters in marriages based on mutual respect and transparency husbands and wives make all decisions about finances together and both have access to all information loyalty is a form of respect prophets teach that successful marriage partners are fiercely loyal to each other7 they keep their social media use fully worthy in every way they permit themselves no secret internet experiences they freely share with each other their social network passwords they do not look at the virtual profiles of anyone in any way that might betray the sacred trust of their spouse they never do or say anything that approaches the appearance of impropriety either virtually or physically watch and learn terrific marriages are completely respectful transparent and loyal fifth love the happiest marriages i have seen radiate obedience to one of the happiest commandmentsthat we live together in love8 speaking to husbands the lord commanded thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart and shalt cleave unto her and none else9 a church handbook teaches the word cleave means to be completely devoted and faithful to someone married couples cleave to god and one another by serving and loving each other and by keeping covenants in complete fidelity to one another and to god both the husband and wife leave behind their single life and establish their marriage as their first priority they allow no other person or interest to have greater priority than keeping the covenants they have made with god and each other10 watch and learn successful couples love each other with complete devotion there are those whose marriages are not as happy as they would wish as well as those who have never married are divorced are single parents or for various reasons are not in a position to marry these circumstances can be full of challenge and heartbreak but they need not be eternal to those of you in such situations who nevertheless cheerfully do all things that lie in your power11 to persevere may heaven bless you richly seek after the ideal of forming an eternal marriage including by striving or preparing to be a worthy spouse keep the commandments and trust the lord and his perfect love for you one day every promised blessing concerning marriage will be yours12 one of the sweetest verses in the book of mormon states simply and they were married and given in marriage and were blessed according to the multitude of the promises which the lord had made unto them13 the promises of the lord are extended to all those who follow the pattern of life that builds happy holy marriage relationships such blessings come as the delightful predictable consequences of faithfully living the gospel of jesus christ i am grateful for my wonderful wife kathy who is the love of my life marriage is a gift from god to us the quality of our marriages is a gift from us to him i bear testimony of the marvelous plan of our loving heavenly father which provides for eternal
