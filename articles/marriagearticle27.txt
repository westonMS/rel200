protect the children by elder dallin h oaks of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder dallin h oaks none should resist the plea that we unite to increase our concern for the welfare and future of our childrenthe rising generation we can all remember our feelings when a little child cried out and reached up to us for help a loving heavenly father gives us those feelings to impel us to help his children please recall those feelings as i speak about our responsibility to protect and act for the wellbeing of children i speak from the perspective of the gospel of jesus christ including his plan of salvation that is my calling local church leaders have responsibility for a single jurisdiction like a ward or stake but an apostle is responsible to witness to the entire world in every nation of every race and creed all children are children of god although i do not speak in terms of politics or public policy like other church leaders i cannot speak for the welfare of children without implications for the choices being made by citizens public officials and workers in private organizations we are all under the saviors command to love and care for each other and especially for the weak and defenseless children are highly vulnerable they have little or no power to protect or provide for themselves and little influence on so much that is vital to their wellbeing children need others to speak for them and they need decision makers who put their wellbeing ahead of selfish adult interests i worldwide we are shocked at the millions of children victimized by evil adult crimes and selfishness in some wartorn countries children are abducted to serve as soldiers in contending armies a united nations report estimates that over two million children are victimized each year through prostitution and pornography1 from the perspective of the plan of salvation one of the most serious abuses of children is to deny them birth this is a worldwide trend the national birthrate in the united states is the lowest in 25 years2 and the birthrates in most european and asian countries have been below replacement levels for many years this is not just a religious issue as rising generations diminish in numbers cultures and even nations are hollowed out and eventually disappear one cause of the diminishing birthrate is the practice of abortion worldwide there are estimated to be more than 40 million abortions per year3 many laws permit or even promote abortion but to us this is a great evil other abuses of children that occur during pregnancy are the fetal impairments that result from the mothers inadequate nutrition or drug use there is a tragic irony in the multitude of children eliminated or injured before birth while throngs of infertile couples long for and seek babies to adopt childhood abuses or neglect of children that occur after birth are more publicly visible worldwide almost eight million children die before their fifth birthday mostly from diseases both treatable and preventable4 and the world health organization reports that one in four children have stunted growth mentally and physically because of inadequate nutrition5 living and traveling internationally we church leaders see much of this the general presidency of the primary report children living in conditions beyond our imaginations a mother in the philippines said sometimes we do not have enough money for food but that is all right because it gives me the opportunity to teach my children about faith we gather and pray for relief and the children see the lord bless us6 in south africa a primary worker met a little girl lonely and sad in faint responses to loving questions she said she had no mother no father and no grandmotheronly a grandfather to care for her7 such tragedies are common on a continent where many caregivers have died of aids even in rich nations little children and youth are impaired by neglect children growing up in poverty have inferior health care and inadequate educational opportunities they are also exposed to dangerous environments in their physical and cultural surroundings and even from the neglect of their parents elder jeffrey r holland recently shared the experience of an lds police officer in an investigation he found five young children huddled together and trying to sleep without bedding on a filthy floor in a dwelling where their mother and others were drinking and partying the apartment had no food to relieve their hunger after tucking the children into a makeshift bed the officer knelt and prayed for their protection as he walked toward the door one of them about six pursued him grabbed him by the hand and pleaded will you please adopt me8 we remember our saviors teaching as he placed a little child before his followers and declared and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea matthew 1856 when we consider the dangers from which children should be protected we should also include psychological abuse parents or other caregivers or teachers or peers who demean bully or humiliate children or youth can inflict harm more permanent than physical injury making a child or youth feel worthless unloved or unwanted can inflict serious and longlasting injury on his or her emotional wellbeing and development9 young people struggling with any exceptional condition including samegender attraction are particularly vulnerable and need loving understandingnot bullying or ostracism10 with the help of the lord we can repent and change and be more loving and helpful to childrenour own and those around us ii there are few examples of physical or emotional threats to children as important as those arising out of their relationships with their parents or guardians president thomas s monson has spoken of what he called the vile deeds of child abuse where a parent has broken or disfigured a child physically or emotionally11 i grieved as i had to study the shocking evidence of such cases during my service on the utah supreme court of utmost importance to the wellbeing of children is whether their parents were married the nature and duration of the marriage and more broadly the culture and expectations of marriage and child care where they live two scholars of the family explain throughout history marriage has first and foremost been an institution for procreation and raising children it has provided the cultural tie that seeks to connect the father to his children by binding him to the mother of his children yet in recent times children have increasingly been pushed from center stage12 a harvard law professor describes the current law and attitude toward marriage and divorce the current american story about marriage as told in the law and in much popular literature goes something like this marriage is a relationship that exists primarily for the fulfillment of the individual spouses if it ceases to perform this function no one is to blame and either spouse may terminate it at will children hardly appear in the story at most they are rather shadowy characters in the background13 our church leaders have taught that looking upon marriage as a mere contract that may be entered into at pleasure and severed at the first difficulty is an evil meriting severe condemnation especially where children are made to suffer14 and children are impacted by divorces over half of the divorces in a recent year involved couples with minor children15 many children would have had the blessing of being raised by both of their parents if only their parents had followed this inspired teaching in the family proclamation husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness to provide for their physical and spiritual needs and to teach them to love and serve one another16 the most powerful teaching of children is by the example of their parents divorcing parents inevitably teach a negative lesson there are surely cases when a divorce is necessary for the good of the children but those circumstances are exceptional17 in most marital contests the contending parents should give much greater weight to the interests of the children with the help of the lord they can do so children need the emotional and personal strength that come from being raised by two parents who are united in their marriage and their goals as one who was raised by a widowed mother i know firsthand that this cannot always be achieved but it is the ideal to be sought whenever possible children are the first victims of current laws permitting socalled nofault divorce from the standpoint of children divorce is too easy summarizing decades of social science research a careful scholar concluded that the family structure that produces the best outcomes for children on average are two biological parents who remain married18 a new york times writer noted the striking fact that even as traditional marriage has declined in the united states the evidence has mounted for the institutions importance to the wellbeing of children19 that reality should give important guidance to parents and parentstobe in their decisions involving marriage and divorce we also need politicians policy makers and officials to increase their attention to what is best for children in contrast to the selfish interests of voters and vocal advocates of adult interests children are also victimized by marriages that do not occur few measures of the welfare of our rising generation are more disturbing than the recent report that 41 percent of all births in the united states were to women who were not married20 unmarried mothers have massive challenges and the evidence is clear that their children are at a significant disadvantage when compared with children raised by married parents21 most of the children born to unmarried mothers58 percentwere born to couples who were cohabitating22 whatever we may say about these couples forgoing marriage studies show that their children suffer significant comparative disadvantages23 for children the relative stability of marriage matters we should assume the same disadvantages for children raised by couples of the same gender the social science literature is controversial and politically charged on the longterm effect of this on children principally because as a new york times writer observed samesex marriage is a social experiment and like most experiments it will take time to understand its consequences24 iii i have spoken for childrenchildren everywhere some may reject some of these examples but none should resist the plea that we unite to increase our concern for the welfare and future of our childrenthe rising generation we are speaking of the children of god and with his powerful help we can do more to help them in this plea i address not only latterday saints but also all persons of religious faith and others who have a value system that causes them to subordinate their own needs to those of others especially to the welfare of children25 religious persons are also conscious of the saviors new testament teaching that pure little children are our role models of humility and teachableness verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven matthew 1834 in the book of mormon we read of the risen lord teaching the nephites that they must repent and be baptized and become as a little child or they could not inherit the kingdom of god 3 nephi 1138 see also moroni 810 i pray that we will humble ourselves as little children and reach out to protect our little children for they are the future for us for our church and for our
