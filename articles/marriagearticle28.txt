brethren we have work to do by elder d todd christofferson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder d todd christofferson as men of the priesthood we have an essential role to play in society at home and in the church brethren much has been said and written in recent years about the challenges of men and boys a sampling of book titles for example includes why there are no good men left the demise of guys the end of men why boys fail and manning up interestingly most of these seem to have been written by women in any case a common thread running through these analyses is that in many societies today men and boys get conflicting and demeaning signals about their roles and value in society the author of manning up characterized it this way its been an almost universal rule of civilization that whereas girls became women simply by reaching physical maturity boys had to pass a test they needed to demonstrate courage physical prowess or mastery of the necessary skills the goal was to prove their competence as protectors of women and children this was always their primary social role today however with women moving ahead in an advanced economy provider husbands and fathers are now optional and the character qualities men had needed to play their rolefortitude stoicism courage fidelityare obsolete and even a little embarrassing1 in their zeal to promote opportunity for women something we applaud there are those who denigrate men and their contributions they seem to think of life as a competition between male and femalethat one must dominate the other and now its the womens turn some argue that a career is everything and marriage and children should be entirely optionaltherefore why do we need men2 in too many hollywood films tv and cable shows and even commercials men are portrayed as incompetent immature or selfabsorbed this cultural emasculation of males is having a damaging effect in the united states for example it is reported girls outperform boys now at every level from elementary school through graduate school by eighth grade for instance only 20 percent of boys are proficient in writing and 24 percent proficient in reading young mens sat scores meanwhile in 2011 were the worst theyve been in 40 years according to the national center for education statistics nces boys are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of both high school and college it is predicted that women will earn 60 percent of bachelors 63 percent of masters and 54 percent of doctorate degrees by 2016 twothirds of students in special education remedial programs are guys3 some men and young men have taken the negative signals as an excuse to avoid responsibility and never really grow up in an observation that is too often accurate one university professor remarked the men come into class with their backward baseball caps and their lame the word processor ate my homework excuses meanwhile the women are checking their day planners and asking for recommendations for law school4 one female movie reviewer expressed the rather cynical view that what we can count on men for if were lucky and we choose to have a partner is to be just thata partner someone who stands in his own space even as he respects our standing in our own5 brethren it cannot be this way with us as men of the priesthood we have an essential role to play in society at home and in the church but we must be men that women can trust that children can trust and that god can trust in the church and kingdom of god in these latter days we cannot afford to have boys and men who are drifting we cannot afford young men who lack selfdiscipline and live only to be entertained we cannot afford young adult men who are going nowhere in life who are not serious about forming families and making a real contribution in this world we cannot afford husbands and fathers who fail to provide spiritual leadership in the home we cannot afford to have those who exercise the holy priesthood after the order of the son of god waste their strength in pornography or spend their lives in cyberspace ironically being of the world while not being in the world brethren we have work to do young men you need to do well in school and then continue your education beyond high school some of you will want to pursue university studies and careers in business agriculture government or other professions some will excel in the arts music or teaching others will choose a military career or learn a trade over the years i have had a number of craftsmen work on projects and repairs at my home and i have admired the hard work and skill of these men in whatever you choose it is essential that you become proficient so that you can support a family and make a contribution for good in your community and your country i recently saw a video showing a day in the life of a 14yearold young man in india named amar he gets up early and works two jobs before and after school six and a half days a week his income provides a substantial part of his familys livelihood he hurries home on his worn bicycle from his second job after dark and somehow squeezes in a few hours of homework before dropping onto his bed on the floor between sleeping siblings around eleven oclock at night although ive never met him i feel proud of him for his diligence and courage he is doing the very best he can with his limited resources and opportunities and he is a blessing to his family you adult menfathers single adults leaders home teachersbe worthy models and help the rising generation of boys become men teach them social and other skills how to participate in a conversation how to get acquainted and interact with others how to relate to women and girls how to serve how to be active and enjoy recreation how to pursue hobbies without becoming addicted how to correct mistakes and make better choices and so to all who are listening wherever this message may reach you i say as jehovah said to joshua be strong and of a good courage joshua 16 take heart and prepare the best you can whatever your circumstances prepare to be a good husband and father prepare to be a good and productive citizen prepare to serve the lord whose priesthood you hold wherever you are your heavenly father is mindful of you you are not alone and you have the priesthood and the gift of the holy ghost of the many places you are needed one of the very most important is your priesthood quorum we need quorums that provide spiritual nourishment to members on sunday and that also serve we need leaders of quorums who focus on doing the lords work and on supporting quorum members and their families consider missionary work young men you have no time to waste you cant wait to get serious about preparing until you are 17 or 18 aaronic priesthood quorums can help their members understand the oath and covenant of the priesthood and get ready for ordination as elders they can help them understand and prepare for the ordinances of the temple and they can help them get ready for successful missions melchizedek priesthood quorums and the relief society can help parents prepare missionaries who know the book of mormon and who will go into the field fully committed and in each ward and branch these same quorums can lead out in an effective collaboration with the fulltime missionaries who are serving there a related work that rests primarily on priesthood shoulders is the saviors call echoed by president thomas s monson to rescue those who have drifted from the gospel or who have become disaffected for any reason we have had wonderful success in this effort including excellent work by young men an aaronic priesthood quorum in the rio grande spanish ward in albuquerque new mexico counseled together about whom they could bring back and then as a group went to visit each of them one said when they came to my door i felt important and another confided i feel happy inside that someone actually wants me to go to church it makes me want to go to church now when the quorum members invited one young man to come back they asked him to come with them on the next visit and he did they were not just inviting him to attend church they were immediately making him a part of the quorum another challenging but stimulating priesthood work is that of family history and the temple watch for a first presidency letter arriving shortly that will offer a renewed call and a higher vision of this vital part of the work we have to do our quorums also form a brotherhood of mutual support president gordon b hinckley once said it will be a marvelous day my brethrenit will be a day of fulfillment of the purposes of the lordwhen our priesthood quorums become an anchor of strength to every man belonging thereto when each such man may appropriately be able to say i am a member of a priesthood quorum of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints i stand ready to assist my brethren in all of their needs as i am confident they stand ready to assist me in mine working together we can stand without embarrassment and without fear against every wind of adversity that might blow be it economic social or spiritual6 despite our best efforts things dont always work out as we have planned and a particular wind of adversity that can come into a mans life is unemployment an early church welfare pamphlet stated a man out of work is of special moment to the church because deprived of his inheritance he is on trial as job was on trialfor his integrity as days lengthen into weeks and months and even years of adversity the hurt grows deeper the church cannot hope to save a man on sunday if during the week it is a complacent witness to the crucifixion of his soul7 in april 2009 former presiding bishopric counselor richard c edgley told the story of an exemplary quorum that mobilized to assist a fellow member who had lost his job phils auto of centerville utah is a testament of what priesthood leadership and a quorum can accomplish phil was a member of an elders quorum and worked as a mechanic at a local automobile repair shop unfortunately the repair shop where phil worked experienced economic trouble and had to let phil go from his job he was devastated by this turn of events on hearing about phils job loss his bishop leon olson and his elders quorum presidency prayerfully considered ways they could help phil get back on his feet after all he was a fellow quorum member a brother and he needed help they concluded that phil had the skills to run his own business one of the quorum members offered that he had an old barn that perhaps could be used as a repair shop other quorum members could help gather needed tools and supplies to equip the new shop almost everyone in the quorum could at least help clean the old barn they shared their ideas with phil then they shared their plan with the members of their quorum the barn was cleaned and renovated the tools gathered and all was put in order phils auto was a success and eventually moved to better and more permanent quartersall because his quorum brothers offered help in a time of crisis8 of course as has been repeated by prophets over the years the most important of the lords work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes9 we have much to do to strengthen marriage in societies that increasingly trivialize its importance and purpose we have much to do to teach our children to pray and to walk uprightly before the lord dc 6828 our task is nothing less than to help our children experience the mighty change of heart or conversion to the lord spoken of so eloquently in the book of mormon see mosiah 5112 alma 26 together with the relief society priesthood quorums can build up parents and marriages and quorums can provide the blessings of the priesthood to singleparent families yes brethren we have work to do thank you for the sacrifices you make and the good you do keep going and the lord will help you at times you may not know quite what to do or what to sayjust move forward begin to act and the lord assures that an effectual door shall be opened for you dc 1183 begin to speak and he promises you shall not be confounded before men for it shall be given you in the very hour yea in the very moment what ye shall say dc 10056 it is true that we are in many ways ordinary and imperfect but we have a perfect master who wrought a perfect atonement and we have call upon his grace and his priesthood as we repent and purge our souls we are promised that we will be taught and endowed with power from on high see dc 4316 the church and the world and women are crying for men men who are developing their capacity and talents who are willing to work and make sacrifices who will help others achieve happiness and salvation they are crying rise up o men of god10 god help us to do it in the name of jesus christ amen
