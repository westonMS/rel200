slow to anger by president gordon b hinckley president of the church imagepresident gordon b hinckley may the lord bless you and inspire you to walk without anger my beloved brethren wherever you may be here in the conference center or in a church hall far away across the seas what a remarkable thing it is that we can speak in this conference center and that you can hear what we say in a place as far away as cape town south africa i have chosen tonight to speak to the subject of anger i realize that this is a little unusual but i think it is timely a proverb in the old testament states he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city proverbs 1632 it is when we become angry that we get into trouble the road rage that affects our highways is a hateful expression of anger i dare say that most of the inmates of our prisons are there because they did something when they were angry in their wrath they swore they lost control of themselves and terrible things followed even murder there were moments of offense followed by years of regret this story is told concerning charles w penrose he was a convert to the church and served as a missionary in england for some 11 years when he was released he sold some of his belongings to pay for his trip to zion some of the saints observing him said that he was taking church property this angered him so that he went upstairs in his residence sat down and wrote these verses which are familiar to you see karen lynn davidson our latterday hymns the stories and the messages 1988 323 school thy feelings o my brother train thy warm impulsive soul do not its emotions smother but let wisdoms voice control school thy feelings there is power in the cool collected mind passion shatters reasons tower makes the clearest vision blind school thy feelings condemnation never pass on friend or foe though the tide of accusation like a flood of truth may flow hear defense before deciding and a ray of light may gleam showing thee what filth is hiding underneath the shallow stream school thy feelings o my brother train thy warm impulsive soul do not its emotions smother but let wisdoms voice control school thy feelings hymns no 336 many years ago i worked for one of our railroads a switchman was aimlessly strolling about the platform one day i asked him to move a car to another track he exploded he threw his cap on the pavement and jumped up and down on it swearing like a drunken sailor i stood there and laughed at his childish behavior noting my laughter he began to laugh at his own foolishness he then quietly climbed on the switch engine drove it over to the empty car and moved it to an empty track i thought of a verse from ecclesiastes be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the bosom of fools ecclesiastes 79 anger is the mother of a whole brood of evil actions i clipped from the morning newspaper a story that led off with this statement more than half the americans who might have celebrated their 25th wedding anniversaries since 2000 were divorced separated or widowed before reaching that milestone sam roberts most us marriages dont get to silver deseret morning news sept 20 2007 p a1 widowhood of course is beyond the control of the parties but divorce and separation are not divorce too often is the bitter fruit of anger a man and a woman fall in love as they say each is wonderful in the sight of the other they feel romantic affection for no one else they stretch their finances to buy a diamond ring they marry all is blissthat is for a season then little inconsequential activities lead to criticism little flaws are magnified into great torrents of faultfinding they fall apart they separate and then with rancor and bitterness they divorce it is the cycle which is repeated again and again in thousands of cases it is tragic and as i have said it is in most cases the bitter fruit of anger i think of my own marriage my eternal companion passed away three and a half years ago but we lived together for 67 years i have no recollection of ever having a quarrel with her she traveled with me and spoke on every continent pleading for the exercise of restraint kindness and love a small publication that came to me some years ago carried the following once a man who had been slandered by a newspaper came to edward everett asking what to do about it said everett do nothing half the people who bought the paper never saw the article half of those who saw it did not read it half of those who read it did not understand it half of those who understood it did not believe it half of those who believed it are of no account anyway sunny side of the street nov 1989 see also zig ziglar staying up up up in a down down world 2000 174 so many of us make a great fuss of matters of small consequence we are so easily offended happy is the man who can brush aside the offending remarks of another and go on his way grudges if left to fester can become serious maladies like a painful ailment they can absorb all of our time and attention guy de maupassant has written an interesting chronicle that illustrates this it concerns master hauchecome who on market day went to town he was afflicted with rheumatism and as he stumbled along he noticed a piece of string on the ground in front of him he picked it up and carefully put it in his pocket he was seen doing so by his enemy the harness maker at the same time it was reported to the mayor that a pocketbook containing money had been lost it was assumed that what hauchecome had picked up was the pocketbook and he was accused of taking it he vehemently denied the charge a search of his clothing disclosed only the piece of string but the slander against him had so troubled him that he became obsessed with it wherever he went he bothered to tell people about it he became such a nuisance that they cried out against him it sickened him his mind kept growing weaker and about the end of december he took to his bed he passed away early in january and in the ravings of his death agony he protested his innocence repeating a little piece of stringa little piece of string see here it is mister mayor see the piece of string httpwwwonlineliteraturecommaupassant270 the story is told that reporters were interviewing a man on his birthday he had reached an advanced age they asked him how he had done it he replied when my wife and i were married we determined that if we ever got in a quarrel one of us would leave the house i attribute my longevity to the fact that i have breathed good fresh air throughout my married life anger may be justified in some circumstances the scriptures tell us that jesus drove the moneychangers from the temple saying my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves matthew 2113 but even this was spoken more as a rebuke than as an outburst of uncontrolled anger now my dear brethren in closing i plead with you to control your tempers to put a smile upon your faces which will erase anger speak out with words of love and peace appreciation and respect if you will do this your lives will be without regret your marriages and family relationships will be preserved you will be much happier you will do greater good you will feel a sense of peace that will be wonderful may the lord bless you and inspire you to walk without anger without bitterness of any kind but to reach out to others with expressions of friendship appreciation and love this is my humble prayer in the name of jesus christ amen
