priesthood authority in the family and the church by elder dallin h oaks of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder dallin h oaks there are many similarities and some differences in the way priesthood authority functions in the family and in the church my subject is priesthood authority in the family and in the church i my father died when i was seven i was the oldest of three small children our widowed mother struggled to raise when i was ordained a deacon she said how pleased she was to have a priesthood holder in the home but mother continued to direct the family including calling on which one of us would pray when we knelt together each morning i was puzzled i had been taught that the priesthood presided in the family there must be something i didnt know about how that principle worked about this same time we had a neighbor who dominated and sometimes abused his wife he roared like a lion and she cowered like a lamb when they walked to church she always walked a few steps behind him that made my mother mad she was a strong woman who would not accept such domination and she was angry to see another woman abused in that way i think of her reaction whenever i see men misusing their authority to gratify their pride or exercise control or compulsion upon their wives in any degree of unrighteousness see dc 12137 i have also seen some faithful women who misunderstand how priesthood authority functions mindful of their partnership relationship with their husband in the family some wives have sought to extend that relationship to their husbands priesthood calling such as bishop or mission president in contrast some single women who have been abused by men such as in a divorce mistakenly confuse the priesthood with male abuse and become suspicious of any priesthood authority a person who has had a bad experience with a particular electrical appliance should not forego using the power of electricity each of the circumstances i have described results from misunderstanding priesthood authority and the great principle that while this authority presides in both the family and the church the priesthood functions in a different way in each of them this principle is understood and applied by the great church and family leaders i have known but it is rarely explained even the scriptures which record various exercises of priesthood authority seldom state expressly which principles only apply to the exercise of priesthood authority in the family or in the church or which apply in both of them ii in our theology and in our practice the family and the church have a mutually reinforcing relationship the family is dependent upon the church for doctrine ordinances and priesthood keys the church provides the teachings authority and ordinances necessary to perpetuate family relationships to the eternities we have programs and activities in both the family and the church each is so interrelated that service to one is service to the other when children see their parents faithfully perform church callings it strengthens their family relationships when families are strong the church is strong the two run in parallel each is important and necessary and each must be conducted with careful concern for the other church programs and activities should not be so allencompassing that families cannot have everyone present for family time and family activities should not be scheduled in conflict with sacrament meeting or other vital church meetings we need both church activities and family activities if all families were complete and perfect the church could sponsor fewer activities but in a world where many of our youth grow up in homes where one parent is missing not a member or otherwise inactive in gospel leadership there is a special need for church activities to fill in the gaps our widowed mother wisely saw that church activities would provide her sons with experiences she could not provide because we had no male role model in the home i remember her urging me to watch and try to be like the good men in our ward she pushed me to participate in scouting and other church activities that would provide this opportunity in a church where there are many single members who do not presently have the companionship the lord intends for all of his sons and daughters the church and its families should also have special concern for the needs of single adults iii priesthood authority functions in both the family and the church the priesthood is the power of god used to bless all of his children male and female some of our abbreviated expressions like the women and the priesthood convey an erroneous idea men are not the priesthood priesthood meeting is a meeting of those who hold and exercise the priesthood the blessings of the priesthood such as baptism receiving the holy ghost the temple endowment and eternal marriage are available to men and women alike the authority of the priesthood functions in the family and in the church according to the principles the lord has established when my father died my mother presided over our family she had no priesthood office but as the surviving parent in her marriage she had become the governing officer in her family at the same time she was always totally respectful of the priesthood authority of our bishop and other church leaders she presided over her family but they presided over the church iv there are many similarities and some differences in the way priesthood authority functions in the family and in the church if we fail to recognize and honor the differences we encounter difficulties keys one important difference between its function in the church and in the family is the fact that all priesthood authority in the church functions under the direction of the one who holds the appropriate priesthood keys in contrast the authority that presides in the familywhether father or singleparent motherfunctions in family matters without the need to get authorization from anyone holding priesthood keys this family authority includes directing the activities of the family family meetings like family home evenings family prayer teaching the gospel and counseling and disciplining family members it also includes ordained fathers giving priesthood blessings however priesthood keys are necessary to authorize the ordaining or setting apart of family members this is because the organization the lord has made responsible for the performance and recording of priesthood ordinances is the church not the family boundaries church organizations like wards quorums or auxiliaries always have geographic boundaries that limit the responsibility and authority of the callings associated with them in contrast family relationships and responsibilities are not dependent upon where different family members reside duration church callings are always temporary but family relationships are permanent call and release another contrast concerns the initiation and termination of positions in the church a priesthood leader who holds the necessary keys has the authority to call or release persons serving under his direction he can even cause that they lose their membership and have their names blotted out see mosiah 263438 alma 55662 in contrast family relationships are so important that the head of the family lacks the authority to make changes in family membership that can only be done by someone authorized to adjust family relationships under the laws of man or the laws of god thus while a bishop can release a relief society president he cannot sever his relationship with his wife without a divorce under the laws of man again his sealing for eternity cannot be ended without a cancellation procedure under the laws of god similarly a youth serving in a class or quorum presidency can be released by priesthood authority in the ward but parents cannot divorce a child whose life choices are offensive to them family relationships are more enduring than church relationships partnership a most important difference in the functioning of priesthood authority in the family and in the church results from the fact that the government of the family is patriarchal whereas the government of the church is hierarchical the concept of partnership functions differently in the family than in the church the family proclamation gives this beautiful explanation of the relationship between a husband and a wife while they have separate responsibilities in these sacred responsibilities fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners the family a proclamation to the world liahona oct 2004 49 ensign nov 1995 102 emphasis added president spencer w kimball said this when we speak of marriage as a partnership let us speak of marriage as a full partnership we do not want our lds women to be silent partners or limited partners in that eternal assignment please be a contributing and full partner the teachings of spencer w kimball ed edward l kimball 1982 315 president kimball also declared we have heard of men who have said to their wives i hold the priesthood and youve got to do what i say he decisively rejected that abuse of priesthood authority in a marriage declaring that such a man should not be honored in his priesthood the teachings of spencer w kimball 316 there are cultures or traditions in some parts of the world that allow men to oppress women but those abuses must not be carried into the families of the church of jesus christ remember how jesus taught ye have heard that it was said by them of old time but i say unto you matt 52728 for example the savior contradicted the prevailing culture in his considerate treatment of women our guide must be the gospel culture he taught if men desire the lords blessings in their family leadership they must exercise their priesthood authority according to the lords principles for its use no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood only by persuasion by longsuffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned by kindness and pure knowledge dc 1214142 when priesthood authority is exercised in that way in the patriarchal family we achieve the full partnership president kimball taught as declared in the family proclamation happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the lord jesus christ successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith prayer repentance forgiveness respect love and compassion liahona oct 2004 49 ensign nov 1995 102 church callings are performed according to the principles that govern all of us in working under priesthood authority in the church these principles include the persuasion and gentleness taught in the 121st section which are especially necessary in the hierarchal organization of the church the principles i have identified for the exercise of priesthood authority are more understandable and more comfortable for a married woman than for a single woman especially a single woman who has never been married she does not now experience priesthood authority in the partnership relationship of marriage her experiences with priesthood authority are in the hierarchical relationships of the church and some single women feel they have no voice in those relationships it is therefore imperative to have an effective ward council where male and female ward officers sit down together regularly to counsel under the presiding authority of the bishop v i conclude with some general comments and a personal experience the theology of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints centers on the family our relationship to god and the purpose of earth life are explained in terms of the family we are the spirit children of heavenly parents the gospel plan is implemented through earthly families and our highest aspiration is to perpetuate those family relationships throughout eternity the ultimate mission of our saviors church is to help us achieve exaltation in the celestial kingdom and that can only be accomplished in a family relationship no wonder our church is known as a familycentered church no wonder we are distressed at the current legal and cultural deteriorations in the position of marriage and childbearing at a time when the world seems to be losing its understanding of the purpose of marriage and the value of childbearing it is vital that latterday saints have no confusion about these matters the faithful widowed mother who raised us had no confusion about the eternal nature of the family she always honored the position of our deceased father she made him a presence in our home she spoke of the eternal duration of their temple marriage she often reminded us of what our father would like us to do so we could realize the saviors promise that we could be a family forever i recall an experience that shows the effect of her teachings just before christmas one year our bishop asked me as a deacon to help him deliver christmas baskets to the widows of the ward i carried a basket to each door with his greetings when he drove me home there was one basket remaining he handed it to me and said it was for my mother as he drove away i stood in the falling snow wondering why there was a basket for my mother she never referred to herself as a widow and it had never occurred to me that she was to a 12yearold boy she wasnt a widow she had a husband and we had a father he was just away for a while i anticipate that glorious future day when the separated will be reunited and all of us will be made complete as the lord has promised i testify of jesus christ the only begotten son of the eternal father whose priesthood authority and whose atonement and resurrection make it all possible in the name of jesus christ amen
