eternal marriage by elder f burton howard of the seventy imageelder f burton howard if you want something to last forever you treat it differently it becomes special because you have made it so a number of years ago my wife and i went to a garden wedding reception earlier that day we had been to the temple where two young people we knew had been married for time and all eternity they were much in love the circumstances of their meeting had been almost miraculous many tears of happiness were shed we stood in the reception line at the end of a perfect day ahead of us was a close friend of the family as he approached the couple he stopped and in a beautiful clear tenor voice sang to them the stirring words from the book of ruth whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god where thou diest will i die ruth 11617 we were deeply touched and felt reassured about their prospects for happinessthis in part i suppose because my wife and i have had these same words on the wall of our home for many years sadly the significance of these beautiful words is subsiding far too many marriages today end in divorce selfishness sin and personal convenience often prevail over covenants and commitment eternal marriage is a principle which was established before the foundation of the world and was instituted on this earth before death came into it adam and eve were given to each other by god in the garden of eden before the fall the scripture says in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him male and female created he them and blessed them gen 512 emphasis added the prophets have uniformly taught that the consummate and culminating element of gods great plan for the blessing of his children is eternal marriage president ezra taft benson stated faithfulness to the marriage covenant brings the fullest joy here and glorious rewards hereafter the teachings of ezra taft benson 1988 53334 president howard w hunter described celestial marriage as the crowning gospel ordinance and clarified that while it might take somewhat longer for some perhaps even beyond this mortal life it would not be denied to any worthy individual teachings of howard w hunter ed clyde j williams 1997 132 140 president gordon b hinckley has called eternal marriage a wonderful thing see what god hath joined together ensign may 1991 71 and a gift precious beyond all others the marriage that endures ensign may 1974 23 however notwithstanding the grandeur and glory of the gift it is not free in fact it is conditional and having been given it may be withdrawn if we do not keep the conditions of the covenant which accompanies it section 131 of the doctrine and covenants tells us that in the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees and in order to obtain the highest a man that means a woman too must enter into this order of the priesthood meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage dc 13112 a covenant is a sacred promise we promise to do some things and god binds himself to do others to those who keep the covenant of marriage god promises the fulness of his glory eternal lives eternal increase exaltation in the celestial kingdom and a fulness of joy we all know that but sometimes we dont give much thought to what we have to do to receive these blessings the scriptures seem to clearly say that at least three obligations are inherent in this covenant first an eternal marriage is eternal eternal implies continuing growth and improvement it means that man and wife will honestly try to perfect themselves it means that the marriage relationship is not to be frivolously discarded at the first sign of disagreement or when times get hard it signifies that love will grow stronger with time and that it extends beyond the grave it means that each partner will be blessed with the company of the other partner forever and that problems and differences might as well be resolved because they are not going to go away eternal signifies repentance forgiveness longsuffering patience hope charity love and humility all of these things are involved in anything that is eternal and surely we must learn and practice them if we intend to claim an eternal marriage second an eternal marriage is ordained of god this means that the parties to the marriage covenant agree to invite god into their marriage to pray together to keep the commandments to keep wants and passions within certain limits that the prophets have outlined it means to be equal companions and to be just as true and pure outside the home as inside the home that is part of what ordained of god means third eternal marriage is a kind of partnership with god he promises a continuation of lives to those who are sealed together in the temple there is a oneness with the creator implied in the commandment given to adam and eve to multiply and replenish the earth there is an obligation to teach children the gospel for they are his children too thus we have family home evening and scripture study gospel conversations and service to others there would seem to be an obligation to support and sustain each other in callings and roles that each is given to perform how can we claim to be one with god if we cannot sustain one another when the wife is called to serve in the primary or the husband in the bishopric so the covenant of marriage implies at least these things and probably others i may miss the mark but i dont think by far when i say that those who verbally or physically abuse their wives or husbands or those who degrade or demean or exercise unrighteous dominion in a marriage are not keeping the covenant nor are those who neglect the commandments or who fail to sustain their leaders even those who merely decline callings neglect neighbors or moderately adopt worldly ways are at risk if we are not keeping our part of the covenant we have no promise most of all i think eternal marriage cannot be achieved without a commitment to make it work most of what i know about this i have learned from my companion we have been married for almost 47 years now from the beginning she knew what kind of marriage she wanted we started as poor college students but her vision for our marriage was exemplified by a set of silverware as is common today when we married she registered with a local department store instead of listing all the pots and pans and appliances we needed and hoped to receive she chose another course she asked for silverware she chose a pattern and the number of place settings and listed knives forks and spoons on the wedding registry and nothing else no towels no toasters no televisionjust knives forks and spoons the wedding came and went our friends and our parents friends gave gifts we departed for a brief honeymoon and decided to open the presents when we returned when we did so we were shocked there was not a single knife or fork in the lot we joked about it and went on with our lives two children came along while we were in law school we had no money to spare but when my wife worked as a parttime election judge or when someone gave her a few dollars for her birthday she would quietly set it aside and when she had enough she would go to town to buy a fork or a spoon it took us several years to accumulate enough pieces to use them when we finally had service for four we began to invite some of our friends for dinner before they came we would have a little discussion in the kitchen which utensils would we use the battered and mismatched stainless or the special silverware in those early days i would often vote for the stainless it was easier you could just throw it in the dishwasher after the meal and it took care of itself the silver on the other hand was a lot of work my wife had it hidden away under the bed where it could not be found easily by a burglar she had insisted that i buy a tarnishfree cloth to wrap it in each piece was in a separate pocket and it was no easy task to assemble all the pieces when the silver was used it had to be hand washed and dried so that it would not spot and put back in the pockets so it would not tarnish and wrapped up and carefully hidden again so it would not get stolen if any tarnish was discovered i was sent to buy silver polish and together we carefully rubbed the stains away over the years we added to the set and i watched with amazement how she cared for the silver my wife was never one to get angry easily however i remember the day when one of our children somehow got hold of one of the silver forks and wanted to use it to dig up the backyard that attempt was met with a fiery glare and a warning not to even think about it ever i noticed that the silverware never went to the many ward dinners she cooked or never accompanied the many meals she made and sent to others who were sick or needy it never went on picnics and never went camping in fact it never went anywhere and as time went by it didnt even come to the table very often some of our friends were weighed in the balance found wanting and didnt even know it they got the stainless when they came to dinner the time came when we were called to go on a mission i arrived home one day and was told that i had to rent a safedeposit box for the silver she didnt want to take it with us she didnt want to leave it behind and she didnt want to lose it for years i thought she was just a little bit eccentric and then one day i realized that she had known for a long time something that i was just beginning to understand if you want something to last forever you treat it differently you shield it and protect it you never abuse it you dont expose it to the elements you dont make it common or ordinary if it ever becomes tarnished you lovingly polish it until it gleams like new it becomes special because you have made it so and it grows more beautiful and precious as time goes by eternal marriage is just like that we need to treat it just that way i pray that we may see it for the priceless gift that it is in the name of jesus christ amen
