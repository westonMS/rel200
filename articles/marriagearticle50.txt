dad are you awake by elder f melvin hammond of the seventy imageelder f melvin hammond do your sons ever wonder if you are asleep when it comes to the things that are most important to them a short while ago elder pace elder condie and i met with the first presidency as we entered the room president hinckley looked carefully at us and then with a smile on his face said how can three whiteheaded old men be the young men presidency of this church our only response was because you called us to be president young men we hope that you are excited about the aaronic priesthood fulfilling our duty to god program it has been introduced to all of the aaronic priesthood throughout the world it is designed to bless you spiritually physically socially and mentally the requirements are meaningful and will stretch you almost to the limits of your capability you will be able to establish personal goals and achieve them with the help of your parents and your great leaders there is a wonderful excitement associated with this program all over the church we want every one of you to qualify and receive the coveted duty to god award many years ago i took our only son on his first camping fishing trip he was just a boy the canyon was steep and the descent was difficult but the fishing was good every time i hooked a fish i would give the pole to the eager boy and with shouts of joy he would reel in a beautiful trout in the shadows and coolness of the late afternoon we began our climb back up to the rim high above us he scrambled rapidly up the mountain ahead of me with a challenging come on dad ill bet i can beat you to the top the challenge was heard but wisely ignored his small frame seemed literally to fly over under and around every obstacle and when every step that i took seemed ridiculously like my last he had reached the top and stood cheering me on after supper we knelt in prayer his small voice rose sweetly heavenward in benediction to our day then we climbed into our large double sleeping bag and after a bit of pushing and pulling i felt his little body snuggle and settle tightly against mine for warmth and security against the night as i looked at my son beside me suddenly i felt a surge of love pass through my body with such force that it pushed tears to my eyes and at that precise moment he put his little arms around me and said dad yes son are you awake yes my son i am awake dad i love you a million trillion times and immediately he was asleep but i was awake far into the night expressing my great thanks for such wonderful blessings clothed with a little boys body now my son is a man with a son of his own once in a while the three of us go fishing i look at my little redheaded grandson beside his father and i see in my minds eye the image of that wonderful moment long ago the question so innocently asked dad are you awake still rings in my heart to every father i pose the same penetrating question dad are you awake do your sons ever wonder if you are asleep when it comes to the things that are most important to them i would suggest that there are several areas that would indicate whether we are awake or asleep in the eyes of our sons first our love for god and accepting our role as the family leader in keeping his commandments some years ago following a stake conference i felt impressed to pay a visit to a priesthood brother who had fallen away from the church we found him working in his garden i approached him and said dear brother the lord jesus christ has sent me to see you i am elder hammond one of his servants we exchanged a latin abrazo and entered into his lovely little home he called for his wife and three children to join us two handsome young men and a beautiful girl sat beside their father and mother i asked the children what they would like more than anything else in the world right now the oldest son spoke if only all of us could go back to church as a family we would be so happyso grateful we told them how much they were needed by the savior and how he loved them we bore our testimonies to them and then knelt in prayer the father prayed the mother wept they are now back in full fellowship the children are proud of their father and they are happy every father in the church should function as the patriarch of his home he should take the lead in spiritually guiding the family he ought not to delegate nor abrogate his responsibilities to the mother he should call for family prayer family home evening scripture reading and occasional father interviews he is the protector the defender and the kindly source of discipline it is the father who should lead unify and solidify the family unit by accepting the priesthood of god and responding to the calls and privileges associated with priesthood authority his relationship with god and his son jesus christ is one of the beacons which will lead his sons and daughters through the stormy shoals of life if dad is a true disciple of jesus christ then the sons will follow him as the night the day dad are you awake second the relationship we have with our wivestheir mothers considering everything else that we do the way we treat our wives could well have the greatest impact on the character of our sons if a father is guilty of inflicting verbal or physical abuse in any degree on his companion his sons will resent him for it perhaps even despise him for it but interestingly enough when they are grown and marry they are likely to follow the same pattern of abuse with their wives there is an urgent need in our society for fathers who respect their wives and treat them with sweet tender love recently i heard of a father who foolishly called his beautiful intelligent wife stupid and dumb in a most degrading manner for some small mistake that she had innocently made the children listened embarrassed and frightened for their mother she was belittled in front of those that she loved most although an apology and forgiveness were expressed there still remained the hurt and shame of a senseless moment the spirit of the lord cannot be expected to bless our lives if we persist in being angry callous and cruel to our mates we cannot expect our sons to develop respect and gentleness toward their mothers if we do not provide the proper example president david o mckay said the most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother quoted from theodore hesburgh readers digest jan 1963 25 in richard evans quote book 1971 11 dad are you awake third to provide discipline that is just and administered with love too often out of our own frustration and weakness we raise our hands to strike our children usually in an attempt to protect our own selfish pride every child needs to be disciplined not only do they need it they expect it they want it discipline gives direction and teaches selfcontrol but in all discipline there should be a sense of righteous judgment and pure love when i was a little boy my widowed mother gave me the most severe discipline possible she said with tears in her eyes my son i am so disappointed in you the pain in my heart was more than i could bear a thousand lashes could not have cut me so deeply i knew that such a rebuke could only have been made to me out of her pure love for if there was one thing that i was certain of it was that my mother loved me i resolved never again to be subject to the disappointment and the broken heart of an angel mother i believe that i have succeeded in that resolve when it comes to discipline dad are you awake dads it is imperative that the challenges i have mentioned be mastered in our lives if our sons are to be spiritually and emotionally mature if we do then they will not be ashamed of us nor will they ever be ashamed of themselves they will become men of honor respect full of love willing to serve the savior and submit their will to him then we will rejoice in the fact that they are ours forever they will say dad are you awake and we will respond yes my son i am awake in the name of jesus christ amen
