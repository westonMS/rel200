set in order thy house by elder russell m nelson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder russell m nelson our family is the focus of our greatest work and joy in this life so will it be throughout all eternity years ago when sister nelson and i had several teenaged daughters we took our family on a vacation far away from telephones and boyfriends we went on a raft trip down the colorado river through the grand canyon as we started our journey we had no idea how dangerous this trip could be the first day was beautiful but on the second day when we approached horn creek rapids and saw that precipitous drop ahead i was terrified floating on a rubber raft our precious family was about to plunge over a waterfall instinctively i put one arm around my wife and the other around our youngest daughter to protect them i tried to hold them close to me but as we reached the precipice the bended raft became a giant sling and shot me into the air i landed into the roiling rapids of the river i had a hard time coming up each time i tried to find air i hit the underside of the raft my family couldnt see me but i could hear them shouting daddy wheres daddy i finally found the side of the raft and rose to the surface the family pulled my nearly drowned body out of the water we were thankful to be safely reunited the next several days were pleasant and delightful then came the last day when we were to go over lava falls known as the most dangerous drop of the journey when i saw what was ahead i immediately asked to beach the raft and hold an emergency family council meeting knowing that if we were to survive this experience we needed to plan carefully i reasoned with our family no matter what happens the rubber raft will remain on top of the water if we cling with all our might to ropes secured to the raft we can make it even if the raft should capsize we will be all right if we hang tightly to the ropes i turned to our little sevenyearold daughter and said all of the others will cling to a rope but you will need to hold on to your daddy sit behind me put your arms around me and hold me tightly while i hold the rope that we did we crossed those steep rough rapidshanging on for dear lifeand all of us made it safely1 the lesson brothers and sisters i nearly lost my life learning a lesson that i now give to you as we go through life even through very rough waters a fathers instinctive impulse to cling tightly to his wife or to his children may not be the best way to accomplish his objective instead if he will lovingly cling to the savior and the iron rod of the gospel his family will want to cling to him and to the savior this lesson is surely not limited to fathers regardless of gender marital status or age individuals can choose to link themselves directly to the savior hold fast to the rod of his truth and lead by the light of that truth by so doing they become examples of righteousness to whom others will want to cling the commandment with the lord families are essential he created the earth that we could gain physical bodies and form families2 he established his church to exalt families he provides temples so that families can be together forever3 of course he expects fathers to preside over provide for and protect their families4 but the master has asked for much more etched in sacred scripture is a commandment to set in order thy house5 once we as parents understand the importance and meaning of that commandment we need to learn how to do it how to set your house in order to set our house in an order pleasing to the lord we need to do it his way we are to employ his attributes of righteousness godliness faith love patience and meekness6 each father should remember that no power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood only by persuasion by longsuffering by gentleness and meekness and by love unfeigned7 parents are to be living examples of kindness and pure knowledge which greatly enlarge the soul8 each mother and father should lay aside selfish interests and avoid any thought of hypocrisy physical force or evil speaking9 parents soon learn that each child has an inborn yearning to be free each individual wants to make his or her own way no one wants to be restrained even by a wellintentioned parent but all of us can cling to the lord ages ago job taught that concept he said my righteousness i hold fast and will not let it go10 nephi also taught whoso would hearken unto the word of god and hold fast unto it would never perish11 these tenets are timeless as the gospel and endless as eternity ponder these additional scriptural admonitions from the old testament proverbs we read take fast hold of instruction let her not go keep her for she is thy life12 from the new testament brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught13 from the book of mormon we learn about multitudes who were continually holding fast to the rod of iron14 likening it to the word of god15 anchored in truth that iron rod is immovable and immutable other divine mandates not only are parents to cling to the word of the lord but they have a divine mandate to teach it to their children scriptural direction is very clear inasmuch as parents have children in zion that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance faith in christ the son of the living god and of baptism and the gift of the holy ghost by the laying on of the hands when eight years old the sin be upon the heads of the parents16 that commandment places responsibility and accountability for the teaching of children squarely upon the shoulders of the parents the proclamation to the world regarding the family warns that individuals who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before god17 today i solemnly reaffirm that reality in discharging these duties we need both the church and the family they work hand in hand to strengthen each other the church exists to exalt the family and the family is the fundamental unit of the church these interrelationships are evident as we study the early history of the church in 1833 the lord rebuked young leaders of his church because of parental shortcomings the lord said i have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth but verily i say unto you you have not taught your children light and truth according to the commandments and now a commandment i give unto you you shall set in order your own house for there are many things that are not right in your house first set in order thy house18 this revelation represents one of the many powerful validations of the integrity of the prophet joseph smith he did not delete from scripture words of stinging rebuke even though some were directed to himself19 in our day the first presidency has again stressed parental priority from their recent letter to the saints i quote we call upon parents to devote their best efforts to the teaching and rearing of their children in gospel principles which will keep them close to the church the home is the basis of a righteous life and no other instrumentality can take its place or fulfill its essential functions in carrying forward this godgiven responsibility20 what should parents teach with this sacred charge in mind let us consider what we should teach scriptures direct parents to teach faith in jesus christ repentance baptism and the gift of the holy ghost21 parents are to teach the plan of salvation22 and the importance of living in complete accord with the commandments of god23 otherwise their children will surely suffer in ignorance of gods redeeming and liberating law24 parents should also teach by example how to consecrate their livesusing their time talents tithing and substance25 to establish the church and kingdom of god upon the earth26 living in that manner will literally bless their posterity a scripture states thy duty is unto the church forever and this because of thy family27 opposition to the family parents and children should realize that strong opposition will always come against the work and will of the lord28 because the work and glory of god is to bring to pass our immortality and eternal life as a family29 it logically follows that the work of the adversary will strike directly at the heart of the homethe family relentlessly lucifer attacks the sanctity of life and the joy of parenthood because the evil one is ever at work our vigilance cannot be relaxednot even for a moment a small and seemingly innocent invitation can turn into a tall temptation which can lead to tragic transgression night and day at home or away we must shun sin and hold fast that which is good30 the seditious evils of pornography abortion and addiction to harmful substances serve as termites to erode the undergirding strength of a happy home and a faithful family we cannot yield to any iniquity without putting our families at risk satan wants us to be miserable just as he is31 he would animate our carnal appetites entice us to live in spiritual darkness and doubt the reality of life after death the apostle paul observed if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable32 perpetuation of family blessings an understanding of gods great plan of happiness however fortifies our faith in the future his plan provides answers to ageless questions are all our sympathies and love for each other only temporaryto be lost in death no can family life endure beyond this period of mortal probation yes god has revealed the eternal nature of celestial marriage and the family as the source of our greatest joy brethren and sisters material possessions and honors of the world do not endure but your union as wife husband and family can the only duration of family life that satisfies the loftiest longings of the human soul is forever no sacrifice is too great to have the blessings of an eternal marriage to qualify one needs only to deny oneself of ungodliness and honor the ordinances of the temple by making and keeping sacred temple covenants we evidence our love for god for our companion and our real regard for our posterityeven those yet unborn our family is the focus of our greatest work and joy in this life so will it be throughout all eternity when we can inherit thrones kingdoms principalities powers dominions exaltation and glory33 these priceless blessings can be ours if we set our houses in order now and faithfully cling to the gospel god lives jesus is
