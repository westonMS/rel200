him into her home and tended him as lovingly as though he were her own son many years later president smith visited the islands as president of the church charles nibley tenderly described the experience it was a beautiful sight to see the deepseated love the even tearful affection that these people had for him in the midst of it all i noticed a poor old blind woman tottering under the weight of about ninety years being led in she had a few choice bananas in her hand it was her allher offering she was calling iosepa iosepa instantly when he saw her he ran to her and clasped her in his arms hugged her and kissed her patting her on the head saying mama mama my dear old mama and with tears streaming down his cheeks he turned to me and said charlie she nursed me when i was a boy sick and without anyone to care for me she took me in and was a mother to me teachings of presidents of the church joseph f smith 1998 xvi 192 we can all extend our arms in love to others and give
