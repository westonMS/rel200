receive the temple blessings by elder richard g scott of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder richard g scott it is a place of peace solitude and inspiration regular attendance will enrich your life with greater purpose one of the most beautiful comforting doctrines of the lordone that brings immense peace happiness and unbounded joyis that principle called eternal marriage this doctrine means that a man and woman who love each other deeply who have grown together through the trials joys sorrows and happiness of a shared lifetime can live beyond the veil together forever with their family who earn that blessing that is not just an immensely satisfying dream it is a reality any husband and wife who have shared the joys of marriage here on earth would want that blessing but only those who meet the requirements established by the lord will receive that supernal gift i bear witness that all those things that have and will bring me the greatest happiness in life have roots in the temple ordinances decide now to receive the ordinances of the temple at the appropriate time dont let anything overcome that resolve if you are now ready to receive the ordinances of the temple prepare carefully for that crowning event before entering the temple you will be interviewed by your bishop and stake president for your temple recommend be honest and candid with them that interview is not a test to be passed but an important step to confirm that you have the maturity and spirituality to receive the supernal ordinances and make and keep the edifying covenants offered in the house of the lord personal worthiness is an essential requirement to enjoy the blessings of the temple anyone foolish enough to enter the temple unworthily will receive condemnation worthy character is best forged from a life of consistent correct choices centered in the teachings of the master for a moment i speak to you who are preparing for that sweet period of discovery known as courtship leading to eternal marriage it can be a wondrously beautiful time of growth and sharing a time when you should focus your thoughts actions and plans on two individuals the parents of your own future children prepare to be a successful parent by being completely worthy in every thought and act during courtship there is more to a foundation of eternal marriage than a pretty face or an attractive figure there is more to consider than popularity or charisma as you seek an eternal companion look for someone who is developing the essential attributes that bring happiness a deep love of the lord and of his commandments a determination to live them one that is kindly understanding forgiving of others and willing to give of self with the desire to have a family crowned with beautiful children and a commitment to teach them the principles of truth in the home an essential priority of a prospective wife is the desire to be a wife and mother she should be developing the sacred qualities that god has given his daughters to excel as a wife and mother patience kindliness a love of children and a desire to care for them rather than seeking professional pursuits she should be acquiring a good education to prepare for the demands of motherhood a prospective husband should also honor his priesthood and use it in service to others seek a man who accepts his role as provider of the necessities of life has the capacity to do it and is making concerted efforts to prepare himself to fulfill those responsibilities i suggest that you not ignore many possible candidates who are still developing these attributes seeking the one who is perfected in them you will likely not find that perfect person and if you did there would certainly be no interest in you these attributes are best polished together as husband and wife since many aspects of the temple experience are significantly different than regular worship services get the counsel of your bishop to help prepare you he can arrange for a specially trained individual to discuss important aspects of the temple to help you understand and appreciate more fully that sacred experience the endowment and sealing ordinances of the temple are so gloriously rich in meaning that you will want to allow significant time to receive those ordinances and to ponder their meaning you may want to divide them into two temple visits on your first visit if possible take an endowed member of your family or a close friend of your own gender to escort you because of the sacred nature of the temple experience you would want to limit those who accompany you to a few family or close friends do not let receptions wedding breakfasts farewells or other activities overshadow the sacred temple experience above all do not be overly concerned you will be helped in every step by caring temple workers they will be intent on making your visit the glorious experience you anticipate outside of the temple we do not speak of the specific sacred matters that unfold there however while within the temple there will be authorized individuals to help answer your questions on your first visit you will receive carefully prepared specific instructions by authorized individuals regarding those matters which are not discussed outside of the temple walls may your first experience in the temple be as moving and inspiring as was mine it will be as you carefully prepare be worthy to commit in courtship intimate acts intended to unfold only within the bonds of marriage is transgression such activity offends the holy ghost lays the foundation for heartache and disappointment and could mask traits or characteristics that could prove conflictive or incompatible within the covenant of marriage seeds of distrust that mature into divorce and loss of temple blessings are often sown through violation of the laws of personal purity dont make that mistake when you are sealed forever in the house of the lord a new family unit is created parents who have had direct responsibility for you since your birth now move into an advisory role their counsel is precious now but you and your eternal companion now make the decisions together as a husband and worthy priesthood bearer you will want to emulate the example of the savior whose priesthood you hold you will make giving of self to wife and children a primary focus of your life occasionally a man attempts to control the destiny of each family member he makes all the decisions his wife is subjected to his personal whims whether that is the custom or not is immaterial it is not the way of the lord it is not the way a latterday saint husband treats his wife and family how grateful i am that president hinckley has been inspired by the lord to construct new temples at an unprecedented rate so that the ordinances are more accessible to members throughout the world if you have received temple ordinances but do not now visit the temple even when there is one nearby with all the tenderness of my heart i invite you to come back to the temple there are many reasons it is a place of peace solitude and inspiration regular attendance will enrich your life with greater purpose it will permit you to provide deceased ancestors the exalting ordinances you have received go to the temple you know it is the right thing to do do it now the temple ordinances are so imbued with symbolic meaning as to provide a lifetime of productive contemplation and learning ponder each word and activity in the temple study how they interrelate as you ponder the significance of those matters think of them in light of your relationship to the savior and his to our father in heaven contemplate how the understanding you receive enhances your earth life by giving proper emphasis on things which are critically important arrange to participate for deceased ancestors in the sealing and other ordinances as well as the endowment i find it helpful when receiving ordinances for another to try and relate to that person specifically i think of him and pray that he will accept the ordinance and benefit from it do these things with a prayer in your heart that the holy spirit will enhance your understanding and enrich your life those worthy prayers will be answered may i share a personal experience to help any who feel anguish when eternal marriage is mentioned since you believe your spouse will not prepare for that sacred experience because of deeply rooted characteristics or habits about five years into our marriage we had a growing experience our precious twoyearold son richard died while undergoing surgery to correct a congenital heart defect within six weeks our daughter andrea passed away at birth my father then not a member of the church loved little richard very much he said to my inactive mother i cannot understand how richard and jeanene seem to be able to accept the loss of these children mother responding to a prompting said kenneth they have been sealed in the temple they know that their children will be with them in the eternities if they live righteously but you and i will not have our five sons because we have not made those covenants my father pondered those words he began to meet with the stake missionaries and was soon baptized in just over a year mother dad and the children were sealed in the temple later president kimball put his hands on my fathers head promised him the vigor and strength of youth and gave him the sealing power he worked as a sealer for 11 years in the washington dc temple with mother at his side you do your part dont abandon hope for a temple marriage if you are single and havent identified a solid prospect for celestial marriage live for it pray for it expect it in the timetable of the lord do not compromise your standards in any way that would rule out that blessing on this or the other side of the veil the lord knows the intent of your heart his prophets have stated that you will have that blessing as you consistently live to qualify for it we do not know whether it will be on this or the other side of the veil but live for it pray for it i know the exquisite joy that comes from an eternal marriage sealed at a temple altar through the holy sealing power when there is righteousness a commitment to give of self obedience to the commandments of god and the resolve to seek his will in all things together that joy is unspeakable i do not have words to express the fulfillment and peace that flow from such a supernal experience even when there is a temporary interruption of the glory of life together on earth it is that joy and happiness i want so much for each of you more importantly that is what your father in heaven wants for you come to the temple now it will greatly bless your life and provide essential ordinances for those beyond the veil that they cannot obtain by themselves i testify that with unimaginable suffering and agony at an incalculable price the savior earned his right to be our intermediary our redeemer our final judge through faith in him and receipt of the requisite ordinances and covenants you will earn your right to the blessings of eternal marriage made possible through his infinite atonement in the name of jesus christ amen
