what are people asking about us by president gordon b hinckley president of the church imagepresident gordon b hinckley i wish to set forth as simply as i know how my response to what people are asking my beloved brothers and sisters it is a tremendous honor to speak on this occasion we are interviewed frequently by the media these days as many of you know i recently appeared on the larry king live television program i consented to do so because i felt that while there were possible hazards in it there also was a great opportunity to speak to the world on issues before us in the course of the show mr king asked me pointblank what is your role youre the leader of a major religion whats your role i replied my role is to declare doctrine my role is to stand as an example before the people my role is to be a voice in defense of the truth my role is to stand as a conservator of those values which are important in our civilization and our society my role is to lead this reply was extemporaneous i never expected that question but in the spirit of that response i have thought this morning that i would like to raise a halfdozen or so questions we are invariably asked by those of the media and other churches for this occasion i must be necessarily brief every one of these issues is worthy of a full discourse i have chosen these questions at random not putting them in any special order except for the first i do not wish to argue with anyone i respect the religion of every man and woman and honor them in their desire to live it i simply wish to set forth as simply as i know how my response to what people are asking about us question 1 what is the mormon doctrine of deity of god since the time of the first vision people have raised this question and they continue to raise it and will do so for so long as they believe in the god of their tradition while we bear testimony of the god of modern revelation the prophet joseph declared it is the first principle of the gospel to know for a certainty the character of god and to know that we may converse with him as one man converses with another teachings of the prophet joseph smith sel joseph fielding smith 1976 345 we believe in god the eternal father and in his son jesus christ and in the holy ghost a of f 11 this first article of faith epitomizes our doctrine we do not accept the athanasian creed we do not accept the nicene creed nor any other creed based on tradition and the conclusions of men we do accept as the basis of our doctrine the statement of the prophet joseph smith that when he prayed for wisdom in the woods the light rested upon me and i saw two personages whose brightness and glory defy all description standing above me in the air one of them spake unto me calling me by name and said pointing to the otherthis is my beloved son hear him jsh 117 two beings of substance were before him he saw them they were in form like men only much more glorious in their appearance he spoke to them they spoke to him they were not amorphous spirits each was a distinct personality they were beings of flesh and bone whose nature was reaffirmed in later revelations which came to the prophet our entire case as members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints rests on the validity of this glorious first vision it was the parting of the curtain to open this the dispensation of the fulness of times nothing on which we base our doctrine nothing we teach nothing we live by is of greater importance than this initial declaration i submit that if joseph smith talked with god the father and his beloved son then all else of which he spoke is true this is the hinge on which turns the gate that leads to the path of salvation and eternal life are we christians of course we are christians we believe in christ we worship christ we take upon ourselves in solemn covenant his holy name the church to which we belong carries his name he is our lord our savior our redeemer through whom came the great atonement with salvation and eternal life question 2 what is your churchs attitude toward homosexuality in the first place we believe that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of god we believe that marriage may be eternal through exercise of the power of the everlasting priesthood in the house of the lord people inquire about our position on those who consider themselves socalled gays and lesbians my response is that we love them as sons and daughters of god they may have certain inclinations which are powerful and which may be difficult to control most people have inclinations of one kind or another at various times if they do not act upon these inclinations then they can go forward as do all other members of the church if they violate the law of chastity and the moral standards of the church then they are subject to the discipline of the church just as others are we want to help these people to strengthen them to assist them with their problems and to help them with their difficulties but we cannot stand idle if they indulge in immoral activity if they try to uphold and defend and live in a socalled samesex marriage situation to permit such would be to make light of the very serious and sacred foundation of godsanctioned marriage and its very purpose the rearing of families question 3 what is your position on abortion according to the centers for disease control and prevention there were more than 1200000 abortions performed in 1995 in the united states alone what has happened to our regard for human life how can women and men deny the great and precious gift of life which is divine in its origin and nature how wonderful a thing is a child how beautiful is a newborn babe there is no greater miracle than the creation of human life abortion is an ugly thing a debasing thing a thing which inevitably brings remorse and sorrow and regret while we denounce it we make allowance in such circumstances as when pregnancy is the result of incest or rape when the life or health of the mother is judged by competent medical authority to be in serious jeopardy or when the fetus is known by competent medical authority to have serious defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth but such instances are rare and there is only a negligible probability of their occurring in these circumstances those who face the question are asked to consult with their local ecclesiastical leaders and to pray in great earnestness receiving a confirmation through prayer before proceeding there is a far better way if there is no prospect of marriage to the man involved leaving the mother alone there remains the very welcome option of placing the child for adoption by parents who will love it and care for it there are many such couples in good homes who long for a child and cannot have one question 4 what is the churchs position on polygamy we are faced these days with many newspaper articles on this subject this has arisen out of a case of alleged child abuse on the part of some of those practicing plural marriage i wish to state categorically that this church has nothing whatever to do with those practicing polygamy they are not members of this church most of them have never been members they are in violation of the civil law they know they are in violation of the law they are subject to its penalties the church of course has no jurisdiction whatever in this matter if any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage they are excommunicated the most serious penalty the church can impose not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law they are in violation of the law of this church an article of our faith is binding upon us it states we believe in being subject to kings presidents rulers and magistrates in obeying honoring and sustaining the law a of f 112 one cannot obey the law and disobey the law at the same time there is no such thing as a mormon fundamentalist it is a contradiction to use the two words together more than a century ago god clearly revealed unto his prophet wilford woodruff that the practice of plural marriage should be discontinued which means that it is now against the law of god even in countries where civil or religious law allows polygamy the church teaches that marriage must be monogamous and does not accept into its membership those practicing plural marriage question 5 to what do you attribute the growth of the church we are growing we are growing in a wonderful way between natural growth and converts baptized we are adding about 400000 per year on a base of 10 million that is about 4 percent which is exceptionally good for a church people are looking for a solid anchor in a world of shifting values they want something they can hold to as the world about them increasingly appears to be in disarray they are welcomed as new converts and are made to feel at home they feel the warmth of the fellowship of the saints they are put to work they are given responsibility they are made to feel a part of the great onward movement of this the work of god and of course we have missionaries to assist them in their search for truth they soon discover that much is expected of them as latterday saints they do not resent it they measure up and they like it they expect their religion to be demanding to require reformation in their lives they meet the requirements they bear testimony of the great good that has come to them they are enthusiastic and faithful question 6 what about spouse and child abuse we condemn most strongly abusive behavior in any form we denounce the physical sexual verbal or emotional abuse of ones spouse or children our proclamation on the family declares husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness to provide for their physical and spiritual needs husbands and wivesmothers and fatherswill be held accountable before god for the discharge of these obligations ensign nov 1995 102 we are doing all we know how to do to stamp out this terrible evil when there is recognition of equality between the husband and the wife when there is acknowledgment that each child born into the world is a child of god then there will follow a greater sense of responsibility to nurture to help to love with an enduring love those for whom we are responsible no man who abuses his wife or children is worthy to hold the priesthood of god no man who abuses his wife or children is worthy to be a member in good standing in this church the abuse of ones spouse and children is a most serious offense before god and any who indulge in it may expect to be disciplined by the church question 7 how does the church finance its operations brother faust has spoken on that very ably this morning those in the outside world wonder how we are able to do so much they speak and write of the church as having great wealth and tremendous assets we do have assets we have houses of worship that dot the earth we are building a large number of new ones every year we carry on a great program of higher education of seminaries and institutes we have an unequaled family history facility we foster a tremendous missionary organization that entails the maintenance of mission homes and other facilities in addition to the cost of maintaining the missionaries which is borne by the missionaries themselves and their families we carry on other programs all of which require money but all of these and more are money consuming and not money creating it costs a great deal to operate this church its worldwide operations are financed through the consecrated tithes of faithful members what a wonderful and glorious principle is the law of tithing it is so simple to understand and follow it is the lords law of finance i thank the lord from the bottom of my heart for the faith of those who pay their honest tithes are they the poorer for it we testify that somehow under the divine providence of the lord he makes it up to us and does so generously it is not a tax it is a voluntary offering given in confidentiality it is a principle that carries with it a remarkable promise god has stated that he will open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it mal 310 that is his promise he has the capacity to fulfill that promise and it is my testimony that he does so well that is all i have time for now there could be many other items these are only a sample of questions that those of a curious world ask of us we have to know this you and i who subscribe to the doctrines of this church that this is gods work directed by the lord jesus christ that it operates according to their plan and their pattern and that it carries with it their blessings why are we such a happy people it is because of our faith the quiet assurance that abides in our hearts that our father in heaven overseeing all will look after his sons and daughters who walk before him with love and appreciation and obedience we will ever be a happy people if we will so conduct our lives sin never was happiness transgression never was happiness falsehood in word or behavior never was happiness happiness lies in obedience to the teachings and commandments of god our eternal father and his beloved son the lord jesus christ as i have said before from this pulpit my brothers and sisters we love you we love you for your faith and goodness we love you for your willingness to do whatever you are asked to do we love you for your obedience to the will of the lord knowing this work to be true we go forward each of us may we make a renewed effort to put on the whole armor of god and look to him is my humble prayer in the name of our redeemer the lord jesus christ amen
