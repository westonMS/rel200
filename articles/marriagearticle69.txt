authorized divinely instituted divinely ordained of god to minister for the salvation of the souls of women and of men therefore there is not any organization that can compare with it that can ever occupy the same stand and platform that this can make relief society first make it foremost make it the highest the best and the deepest of any organization in existence in the world you are called by

greatgreatgrandmother of her greatgrandmother of her grandmother her mother herself her daughter and her newly married granddaughter every woman in that picture for seven generations has been a relief society worker this beautiful family history chart becomes an everpresent reminder to the younger ones of this generation of the great responsibility they carry of the great obligation they have to move forward this work in the tradition of their mothers and grandmothers in service in the relief society organization you and your forebears have walked in the light of the lord from the beginning it has been your most important responsibility to see that no one goes hungry to see that no one goes without adequate clothing that no one goes without shelter it has been and is your responsibility to visit your sisters wherever they may be found to give encouragement as they may need it to assure them of love and concern and interest it is and has been your opportunity to tear away the curtain of darkness that enshrouds those who are illiterate and to bring into their lives the light of understanding as you teach them to read and to write it is and has been your opportunity to mingle together as sisters who love and honor and respect one another to bring the blessings of pleasant sociality into the lives of tens of thousands who without you would be left in very bleak and lonely circumstances i pulled a book from my shelf the other evening i read again the life of mary fielding smith wife of hyrum smith sisterinlaw of joseph smith mother and grandmother of two presidents of the church a convert to the church originally from england and then from canada she came to kirtland in her late 30s there she met and married hyrum smith who was left with six children after the death of his first wife mary loved him and brought an added dimension into his life in that process she set a course which brought her happiness only to be followed by immeasurable sorrow for there was laid upon her a terrifying and fearful responsibility which took her from nauvoo across iowa to winter quarters and in 1848 on the long trail that led to the salt lake valley at the age of 51 she was worn out weary from the struggle she passed away september 21 1852 her life is the epitome of the relief society woman of those days in fact some of her experiences predated the organization of the society in 1842 marys boy joseph was born at a time when her husband was snatched away by the mob militia then terrorizing far west hyrum and the prophet joseph were taken to liberty missouri where they were imprisoned under the compulsion of governor lilburn w boggss extermination order she left missouri with the stepchildren for whom she had taken responsibility as well as her own son her sister mercy placed mary who was seriously ill on a bed in a wagon box with her infant boy cradled at her side in february 1839 when winter was still upon the land they traveled east across the state and then across the mississippi to quincy illinois bumping along in a springless wagon where every jolt brought pain when her husband and the prophet escaped from liberty jail and came to quincy life again improved the saints moved to what became nauvoo and established their beautiful city on the mississippi but their peace was shortlived her little boy was less than six years old when a knock came at night on her window and a man said sister smith your husband has been killed joseph f never forgot his mothers weeping through the night her world was shattered she was on her own now with a large family to care for in the summer of 1846 they bade their comfortable home goodbye and rode a flatboat across the mississippi taking matters into her own hands she was able to trade borrow and barter for ox teams and wagons while living in winter quarters she and her brother went down the missouri river to purchase provisions and clothing they had two wagons each having two yoke of oxen camping for the night they discovered in the morning that their two best oxen were gone young joseph and his uncle spent the entire morning looking for the lost animals they found nothing disheartened he returned to tell his mother their situation was desperate terribly so as he approached he saw her on her knees praying fervently speaking with the lord about their problem when she arose to her feet there was a smile on her face she told her son and her brother to get their breakfast and she would look around following a little stream of water and disregarding the words of a man who was in the area she went directly along the bank of the river pausing she called to her son and brother she pointed to their oxen which had been tied to a clump of willows growing in the bottom of a deep gulch the thief who had tried to misdirect her lost his prize and they were saved marys faith imprinted itself in her sons boyish heart he never forgot it he never doubted her closeness to the lord all of you are familiar with her experience when one of her oxen exhausted and worn lay down to die while they were en route to these valleys in the west in a mixture of utter desperation and simple faith she secured consecrated oil and asked her brother and an associate to administer to the ox they did so it rose to its feet with a renewal of strength and carried them for the remainder of their long journey such was the faith sweet and simple and beautiful which graced this womans life she walked in the light of the lord she lived by that light it guided her in all of her actions it became the lodestar of her life she exemplified the tremendous faith of the women of this churchthe women of the relief society who today on a thousand fronts carry on the dedicated work of this remarkable organization now there is an added challenge for you sisters of this day never before at least not in our generation have the forces of evil been so blatant so brazen so aggressive as they are today things we dared not speak about in earlier times are now constantly projected into our living rooms all sensitivity is cast aside as reporters and pundits speak with a disgusting plainness of things that can only stir curiosity and lead to evil some to whom we have looked as leaders have betrayed us we are disappointed and disillusioned and their activity is only the tip of the iceberg in successive layers beneath that tip is a great mass of sleaze and filth of dissolute and dishonest behavior there is a reason for it i feel it is simple to define i believe our problems almost every one arise out of the homes of the people if there is to be reformation if there is to be a change if there is to be a return to old and sacred values it must begin in the home it is here that truth is learned that integrity is cultivated that selfdiscipline is instilled and that love is nurtured the home is under siege so many families are being destroyed where are the fathers who should be presiding in love in those homes fortunate indeed is the woman who is married to a good man who is loved by him and who in turn loves him a man who loves his children provides for them teaches them guides them rears and protects them as they walk the stormy course from babyhood to adulthood it is in the home that we learn the values by which we guide our lives that home may be ever so simple it may be in a poor neighborhood but with a good father and a good mother it can become a place of wondrous upbringing my wife likes to tell of sam levenson he speaks of growing up in a crowded new york tenement where the environment was anything but good here in this slum his mother reared her eight precocious children he said the moral standard of the home had to be higher than that of the street his mother would say to them when they acted the way they acted on the street you are not on the street you are in our home this is not a cellar nor a poolroom here we act like human beings if anyone can change the dismal situation into which we are sliding it is you rise up o women of zion rise to the great challenge which faces you stand above the sleaze and the filth and the temptation which is all about you you women who are single and some of you who are married who are out in the workplace may i give you a word of caution you work alongside men more and more there are invitations to go to lunch ostensibly to talk about business you travel together you stay in the same hotel you work together perhaps you cannot avoid some of this but you can avoid getting into compromising situations do your job but keep your distance dont become a factor in the breakup of another womans home you are members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints you know what is expected of you stay away from that which is tempting avoid evilits very appearance you who are wives and mothers are the anchors of the family you bear the children what an enormous and sacred responsibility that is i am told that between 1972 and 1990 there were 27 million abortions in the united states alone what is happening to our appreciation of the sanctity of human life abortion is an evil stark and real and repugnant which is sweeping over the earth i plead with the women of this church to shun it to stand above it to stay away from those compromising situations which make it appear desirable there may be some few circumstances under which it can occur but they are extremely limited and for the most part improbable you are the mothers of the sons and daughters of god whose lives are sacred safeguarding them is a divinely given responsibility which cannot be lightly brushed aside nurture and cultivate your marriage guard it and work to keep it solid and beautiful divorce is becoming so common even rampant that studies show in a few years half of those now married will be divorced it is happening i regret to say even among some who are sealed in the house of the lord marriage is a contract it is a compact it is a union between a man and a woman under the plan of the almighty it can be fragile it requires nurture and very much effort i regret to acknowledge that some husbands are abusive some are unkind some are thoughtless some are evil they indulge in pornography and bring about situations which destroy them destroy their families and destroy the most sacred of all relationships i pity the man who at one time looked into the eyes of a beautiful young woman and held her hand across the altar in the house of the lord as they made sacred and everlasting promises one to another but who lacking in selfdiscipline fails to cultivate his better nature sinks to coarseness and evil and destroys the relationship which the lord has provided for him sisters guard your children they live in a world of evil the forces are all about them i am proud of so many of your sons and daughters who are living good lives but i am deeply concerned about many others who are gradually taking on the ways of the world nothing is more precious to you as mothers absolutely nothing your children are the most valuable thing you will have in time or all eternity you will be fortunate indeed if as you grow old and look at those you brought into the world you find in them uprightness of life virtue in living and integrity in their behavior i think the nurture and upbringing of children is more than a parttime responsibility i recognize that some women must work but i fear that there are far too many who do so only to get the means for a little more luxury and a few fancier toys if you must work you have an increased load to bear you cannot afford to neglect your children they need your supervision in studying in working inside and outside the home in the nurturing that only you can adequately givethe love the blessing the encouragement and the closeness of a mother families are being torn asunder everywhere family relationships are strained as women try to keep up with the rigors of two fulltime jobs i have many opportunities to speak with leaders who decry what is going ongangs on the streets of our cities children killing children spending their time in practices that can lead only to prison or to death we face a great overwhelming tide of children born to mothers without husbands the futures of such children are almost inevitably blighted from the day they are born every home needs a good father and a good mother we cannot build prisons fast enough in this country to accommodate the need i do not hesitate to say that you who are mothers can do more than any other group to change this situation all of these problems find their root in the homes of the people it is broken homes that lead to a breakup in society and so tonight my beloved sisters my message to you my challenge to you my prayer is that you will rededicate yourselves to the strengthening of your homes three years ago in this same meeting i read for the first time in public the proclamation on the family given by the first presidency and the council of the twelve apostles i hope every one of you has a copy and that you occasionally read it carefully and prayerfully it sets forth our great concepts of marriage and family of a man and a woman in a sacred bond under the eternal plan of the almighty now in closing i wish to reemphasize my deep gratitude my profound appreciation for the women of this church and the tremendous sons and daughters you are teaching training helping to take their places in the world but the task will never be finished it will never be complete may the light of the lord shine upon you may the lord bless you in your great and sacred work i leave my blessing my testimony and my love with you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
