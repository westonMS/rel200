the great plan by president dallin h oaks first counselor in the first presidency we who know gods plan and who have covenanted to participate have a clear responsibility to teach these truths even in the midst of unique trials and challenges we are truly blessed this general conference has given us an outpouring of the riches and joy of the restoration of the gospel of jesus christ we have rejoiced in the vision of the father and the son that commenced the restoration we have been reminded of the miraculous coming forth of the book of mormon whose central purpose is to testify of jesus christ and his doctrine we have been renewed with the joyful reality of revelationto prophets and to us personally we have heard precious testimonies of the infinite atonement of jesus christ and of his literal resurrection and we have been taught other truths of the fulness of his gospel revealed to joseph smith after god the father declared to that newly called prophet this is my beloved son hear him joseph smithhistory 117 we have been affirmed in our knowledge of the restoration of the priesthood and its keys we have been renewed in our determination to have the lords restored church known by its proper name the church of jesus christ of latterday saints and we have been invited to join in fasting and prayer to minimize the present and future effects of a devastating worldwide pandemic this morning we were inspired by the lords living prophet presenting an historic proclamation of the restoration we affirm its declaration that those who prayerfully study the message of the restoration and act in faith will be blessed to gain their own witness of its divinity and of its purpose to prepare the world for the promised second coming of our lord and savior jesus christ1 the plan all of this is part of a divine plan whose purpose is to enable the children of god to be exalted and become like him referred to in the scriptures as the great plan of happiness the plan of redemption and the plan of salvation alma 428 11 5 that planrevealed in the restorationbegan with a council in heaven as spirits we desired to achieve the eternal life enjoyed by our heavenly parents at that point we had progressed as far as we could without a mortal experience in a physical body to provide that experience god the father planned to create this earth in the planned mortal life we would be soiled by sin as we faced the opposition necessary for our spiritual growth we would also become subject to physical death to reclaim us from death and sin our heavenly fathers plan would provide a savior his resurrection would redeem all from death and his atoning sacrifice would pay the price necessary for all to be cleansed from sin on the conditions prescribed to promote our growth this atonement of jesus christ is central to the fathers plan in the council in heaven all the spirit children of god were introduced to the fathers plan including its mortal consequences and trials its heavenly helps and its glorious destiny we saw the end from the beginning all of the myriads of mortals who have been born on this earth chose the fathers plan and fought for it in the heavenly contest that followed many also made covenants with the father concerning what they would do in mortality in ways that have not been revealed our actions in the spirit world have influenced our circumstances in mortality mortality and spirit world i will now summarize some of the principal elements of the fathers plan as they affect us during our mortal journeys and in the spirit world that follows the purpose of mortal life and the postmortal growth that can follow it is for the offspring of god to become like he is this is heavenly fathers desire for all his children to achieve this joyful destiny eternal laws require that we must become purified beings through the atonement of jesus christ so we can dwell in the presence of the father and the son and enjoy the blessings of exaltation as the book of mormon teaches he invites all to come unto him and partake of his goodness and he denieth none that come unto him black and white bond and free male and female and he remembereth the heathen and all are alike unto god 2 nephi 2633 see also alma 549 the divine plan for us to become what we are destined to become requires us to make choices to reject the evil opposition that tempts mortals to act contrary to gods commandments and his plan it also requires that we be subject to other mortal opposition such as from the sins of others or from some defects of birth sometimes our needed growth is achieved better by suffering and adversity than by comfort and tranquility and none of this mortal opposition could achieve its eternal purpose if divine intervention relieved us from all the adverse consequences of mortality the plan reveals our destiny in eternity the purpose and conditions of our journey in mortality and the heavenly helps we will receive the commandments of god warn us against straying into dangerous circumstances the teachings of inspired leaders guide our path and give assurances that promote our eternal journey gods plan gives us four great assurances to assist our journey through mortality all are given to us through the atonement of jesus christ the centerpiece of the plan the first assures us that through his suffering for the sins of which we repent we can be cleansed of those sins then the merciful final judge will remember them no more doctrine and covenants 5842 second as part of our saviors atonement he took upon him all other mortal infirmities this allows us to receive divine help and strength to bear the inevitable burdens of mortality personal and general such as war and pestilence the book of mormon provides our clearest scriptural description of this essential power of the atonement the savior took upon him the pains and the sicknesses and infirmities of his people he will take upon him their infirmities that his bowels may be filled with mercy according to the flesh that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities alma 71112 third the savior through his infinite atonement revokes the finality of death and gives us the joyful assurance that all of us will be resurrected the book of mormon teaches this restoration shall come to all both old and young both bond and free both male and female both the wicked and the righteous and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost but every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame alma 1144 we celebrate the reality of the resurrection in this easter season this gives us the perspective and strength to endure the mortal challenges faced by each of us and those we love such things as the physical mental or emotional deficiencies we acquire at birth or experience during our mortal lives because of the resurrection we know that these mortal deficiencies are only temporary the restored gospel assures us that the resurrection can include the opportunity to be with our family membershusband wife children and parents this is a powerful encouragement for us to fulfill our family responsibilities in mortality it helps us live together in love in this life in anticipation of joyful reunions and associations in the next fourth and finally modern revelation teaches us that our progress need not conclude with the end of mortality little has been revealed about this important assurance we are told that this life is the time to prepare to meet god and that we should not procrastinate our repentance see alma 343233 still we are taught that in the spirit world the gospel is preached even to the wicked and the disobedient who had rejected the truth doctrine and covenants 13829 and that those taught there are capable of repentance in advance of the final judgment see verses 3134 5759 here are some other fundamentals of our heavenly fathers plan the restored gospel of jesus christ gives us a unique perspective on the subjects of chastity marriage and the bearing of children it teaches that marriage according to gods plan is necessary for accomplishing the purpose of gods plan to provide the divinely appointed setting for mortal birth and to prepare family members for eternal life marriage is ordained of god unto man the lord said that the earth might answer the end of its creation doctrine and covenants 491516 in this his plan of course runs counter to some strong worldly forces in law and custom the power to create mortal life is the most exalted power god has given his children its use was mandated in the first commandment to adam and eve but another important commandment was given to forbid its misuse outside the bonds of marriage all uses of the procreative power are to one degree or another a sinful degrading and perversion of the most divine attribute of men and women the emphasis the restored gospel places on this law of chastity is because of the purpose of our procreative powers in the accomplishment of gods plan what next during this 200th anniversary of the first vision which initiated the restoration we know the lords plan and we are encouraged by two centuries of its blessings through his restored church in this year of 2020 we have what is popularly called 2020 vision for the events of the past as we look to the future however our vision is far less sure we know that two centuries after the restoration the spirit world now includes many mortally experienced workers to accomplish the preaching that occurs there we also know that we now have many more temples to perform the ordinances of eternity for those who repent and embrace the lords gospel on either side of the veil of death all of this furthers our heavenly fathers plan gods love is so great that except for the few who deliberately become sons of perdition he has provided a destiny of glory for all of his children see doctrine and covenants 7643 we know that the savior will return and that there will be a millennium of peaceful reign to wrap up the mortal part of gods plan we also know that there will be different resurrections of the just and the unjust with the final judgment of each person always following his or her resurrection we will be judged according to our actions the desires of our hearts and the kind of person we have become this judgment will cause all of the children of god to proceed to a kingdom of glory for which their obedience has qualified them and where they will be comfortable the judge of all this is our savior jesus christ see john 522 2 nephi 941 his omniscience gives him a perfect knowledge of all of our acts and desires both those unrepented or unchanged and those repented or righteous therefore after his judgment we will all confess that his judgments are just mosiah 161 in conclusion i share the conviction that has come to me from many letters and by reviewing many requests to return to the church after name removal or apostasy many of our members do not fully understand this plan of salvation which answers most questions about the doctrine and inspired policies of the restored church we who know gods plan and who have covenanted to participate have a clear responsibility to teach these truths and do all that we can to further them for others and in our own circumstances in mortality i testify of jesus christ our savior and redeemer who makes it all possible in the name of jesus christ amen note the restoration of the fulness of the gospel of jesus christ a bicentennial proclamation to the world in russell m nelson hear him ensign or liahona may 2020 9192
