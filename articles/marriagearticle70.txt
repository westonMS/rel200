personal purity by elder jeffrey r holland of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder jeffrey r holland one who uses the godgiven body of another without divine sanction abuses the very soul of that individual abuses the central purpose and processes of life as modern winds of immorality swirl luridly around them i am concerned for any of our youth or young adults who may be confused about principles of personal purity about obligations of total chastity before marriage and complete fidelity after it against what is happening in the world they see and hear and hoping to fortify parents as they teach their children a higher standard i wish to speak today about moral cleanliness because this subject is as sacred as any i know i earnestly pray for the holy spirit to guide me in remarks that are more candid than i would wish to make today i know how jacob in the book of mormon felt when he said on the same topic it grieveth me that i must use so much boldness of speech1 in approaching this subject i do not document a host of social ills for which the statistics are as grim as the examples are offensive nor will i present here a checklist of dos and donts about dating and boygirl relationships what i wish to do is more personali wish to try to answer questions some of you may have been asking why should we be morally clean why is it such an important issue to god does the church have to be so strict about it when others dont seem to be how could anything society exploits and glamorizes so openly be very sacred or serious may i begin with a lesson from civilizations long instructive story will and ariel durant have written no man or woman however brilliant or wellinformed can safely dismiss the wisdom of lessons learned in the laboratory of history a youth boiling with hormones will wonder why he should not give full freedom to his sexual desires but if he is unchecked by custom morals or laws he may ruin his life before he understands that sex is a river of fire that must be banked and cooled by a hundred restraints if it is not to consume in chaos both the individual and the group2 a more important scriptural observation is offered by the writer of proverbs can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned whoso committeth adultery destroyeth his own soul a wound and dishonour shall he get and his reproach shall not be wiped away3 why is this matter of sexual relationships so severe that fire is almost always the metaphor with passion pictured vividly in flames what is there in the potentially hurtful heat of this that leaves ones soulor the whole world for that matterdestroyed if that flame is left unchecked and those passions unrestrained what is there in all of this that prompts alma to warn his son corianton that sexual transgression is an abomination in the sight of the lord yea most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the holy ghost4 by assigning such seriousness to a physical appetite so universally bestowed what is god trying to tell us about its place in his plan for all men and women i submit to you he is doing precisely thatcommenting about the very plan of life itself clearly among his greatest concerns regarding mortality are how one gets into this world and how one gets out of it he has set very strict limits in these matters fortunately in the case of how life is terminated most seem to be quite responsible but in the significance of giving life we sometimes find nearcriminal irresponsibility may i offer three reasons why this is an issue of such magnitude and consequence in the gospel of jesus christ first is the revealed restored doctrine of the human soul one of the plain and precious truths restored in this dispensation is that the spirit and the body are the soul of man5 and that when the spirit and body are separated men and women cannot receive a fulness of joy6 that is the reason why obtaining a body is so fundamentally important in the first place why sin of any kind is such a serious matter namely because it is sin that ultimately brings both physical and spiritual death and why the resurrection of the body is so central to the great triumph of christs atonement the body is an essential part of the soul this distinctive and very important latterday saint doctrine underscores why sexual sin is so serious we declare that one who uses the godgiven body of another without divine sanction abuses the very soul of that individual abuses the central purpose and processes of life the very key7 to life as president boyd k packer once called it in exploiting the body of anotherwhich means exploiting his or her soulone desecrates the atonement of christ which saved that soul and which makes possible the gift of eternal life and when one mocks the son of righteousness one steps into a realm of heat hotter and holier than the noonday sun you cannot do so and not be burned please never say who does it hurt why not a little freedom i can transgress now and repent later please dont be so foolish and so cruel you cannot with impunity crucify christ afresh8 flee fornication9 paul cries and flee anything like unto it10 the doctrine and covenants adds why well for one reason because of the incalculable suffering in both body and spirit endured by the savior of the world so that we could flee11 we owe him something for that indeed we owe him everything for that ye are not your own paul says ye have been bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods12 in sexual transgression the soul is at stakethe body and the spirit secondly may i stress that human intimacy is reserved for a married couple because it is the ultimate symbol of total union a totality and a union ordained and defined by god from the garden of eden onward marriage was intended to mean the complete merger of a man and a womantheir hearts hopes lives love family future everything adam said of eve that she was bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh and that they were to be one flesh in their life together13 this is a union of such completeness that we use the word seal to convey its eternal promise the prophet joseph smith once said we perhaps could render such a sacred bond as being welded14 one to another but such a total union such an unyielding commitment between a man and a woman can only come with the proximity and permanence afforded in a marriage covenant with solemn promises and the pledge of all they possesstheir very hearts and minds all their days and all their dreams can you see the moral schizophrenia that comes from pretending you are one pretending you have made solemn promises before god sharing the physical symbols and the physical intimacy of your counterfeit union but then fleeing retreating severing all such other aspects of what was meant to be a total obligation in matters of human intimacy you must wait you must wait until you can give everything and you cannot give everything until you are legally and lawfully married to give illicitly that which is not yours to give remember you are not your own and to give only part of that which cannot be followed with the gift of your whole self is emotional russian roulette if you persist in pursuing physical satisfaction without the sanction of heaven you run the terrible risk of such spiritual psychic damage that you may undermine both your longing for physical intimacy and your ability to give wholehearted devotion to a later truer love you may come to that truer moment of ordained love of real union only to discover to your horror that what you should have saved you have spent and that only gods grace can recover the piecemeal dissipation of the virtue you so casually gave away on your wedding day the very best gift you can give your eternal companion is your very best selfclean and pure and worthy of such purity in return thirdly may i say that physical intimacy is not only a symbolic union between a husband and a wifethe very uniting of their soulsbut it is also symbolic of a shared relationship between them and their father in heaven he is immortal and perfect we are mortal and imperfect nevertheless we seek ways even in mortality whereby we can unite with him spiritually in so doing we gain some access to both the grace and the majesty of his power those special moments include kneeling at a marriage altar in the house of the lord blessing a newborn baby baptizing and confirming a new member of the church partaking of the emblems of the lords supper and so forth these are moments when we quite literally unite our will with gods will our spirit with his spirit where communion through the veil becomes very real at such moments we not only acknowledge his divinity but we quite literally take something of that divinity to ourselves one aspect of that divinity given to virtually all men and women is the use of his power to create a human body that wonder of all wonders a genetically and spiritually unique being never before seen in the history of the world and never to be duplicated again in all the ages of eternity a child your childwith eyes and ears and fingers and toes and a future of unspeakable grandeur probably only a parent who has held that newborn infant in his or her arms understands the wonder of which i speak suffice it to say that of all the titles god has chosen for himself father is the one he favors most and creation is his watchwordespecially human creation creation in his image you and i have been given something of that godliness but under the most serious and sacred of restrictions the only control placed on us is selfcontrolselfcontrol born of respect for the divine sacramental power this gift represents my beloved friends especially my young friends can you see why personal purity is such a serious matter can you understand why the first presidency and council of the twelve apostles would issue a proclamation declaring that the means by which mortal life is created is divinely appointed and that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman lawfully wedded as husband and wife15 dont be deceived and dont be destroyed unless such powers are controlled and commandments kept your future may be burned your world could go up in flames penalty may not come on the precise day of transgression but it comes surely and certainly enough and unless there is true repentance and obedience to a merciful god then someday somewhere the morally cavalier and unclean will pray like the rich man who wished lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame16 i have declared here the solemn word of revelation that the spirit and the body constitute the soul of man and that through the atonement of christ the body shall rise from the grave to unite with the spirit in an eternal existence that body is therefore something to be kept pure and holy do not be afraid of soiling its hands in honest labor do not be afraid of scars that may come in defending the truth or fighting for the right but beware scars that spiritually disfigure that come to you in activities you should not have undertaken that befall you in places where you should not have gone beware the wounds of any battle in which you have been fighting on the wrong side17 if some few of you are carrying such woundsand i know that you areto you is extended the peace and renewal of repentance available through the atoning sacrifice of the lord jesus christ in such serious matters the path of repentance is not easily begun nor painlessly traveled but the savior of the world will walk that essential journey with you he will strengthen you when you waver he will be your light when it seems most dark he will take your hand and be your hope when hope seems all you have left his compassion and mercy with all their cleansing and healing power are freely given to all who truly wish complete forgiveness and will take the steps that lead to it i bear witness of the great plan of life of the powers of godliness of mercy and forgiveness and the atonement of the lord jesus christall of which have profound meaning in matters of moral cleanliness i testify that we are to glorify god in our body and in our spirit i thank heaven for legions of the young who are doing just that and helping others do the same i thank heaven for homes where this is taught that lives of personal purity may be reverenced by all i pray in the name of purity himself even the lord jesus christ amen notes jacob 27 see jacob 23 for the full context of his sermon on chastity the lessons of
