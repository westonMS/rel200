that we may be one by elder henry b eyring of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder henry b eyring the savior of the world spoke of that unity and how we will have our natures changed to make it possible the savior of the world jesus christ said of those who would be part of his church be one and if ye are not one ye are not mine dc 3827 and at the creation of man and woman unity for them in marriage was not given as hope it was a command therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh gen 224 our heavenly father wants our hearts to be knit together that union in love is not simply an ideal it is a necessity the requirement that we be one is not for this life alone it is to be without end the first marriage was performed by god in the garden when adam and eve were immortal he placed in men and women from the beginning a desire to be joined together as man and wife forever to dwell in families in a perfect righteous union he placed in his children a desire to live at peace with all those around them but with the fall it became clear that living in unity would not be easy tragedy struck early cain slew abel his brother the children of adam and eve had become subject to the temptations of satan with skill hatred and cunning satan pursues his goal it is the opposite of the purpose of our heavenly father and the savior they would give us perfect union and eternal happiness satan their enemy and ours has known the plan of salvation from before the creation he knows that only in eternal life can those sacred joyful associations of families endure satan would tear us from loved ones and make us miserable and it is he who plants the seeds of discord in human hearts in the hope that we might be divided and separate all of us have felt something of both union and separation sometimes in families and perhaps in other settings we have glimpsed life when one person put the interests of another above his or her own in love and with sacrifice and all of us know something of the sadness and loneliness of being separate and alone we dont need to be told which we should choose we know but we need hope that we can experience unity in this life and qualify to have it forever in the world to come and we need to know how that great blessing will come so that we can know what we must do the savior of the world spoke of that unity and how we will have our natures changed to make it possible he taught it clearly in the prayer he gave in his last meeting with his apostles before his death that supernally beautiful prayer is recorded in the book of john he was about to face the terrible sacrifice for all of us that would make eternal life possible he was about to leave the apostles whom he had ordained whom he loved and with whom he would leave the keys to lead his church and so he prayed to his father the perfect son to the perfect parent we see in his words the way families will be made one as will all the children of our heavenly father who follow the savior and his servants as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me john 171821 in those few words he made clear how the gospel of jesus christ can allow hearts to be made one those who would believe the truth he taught could accept the ordinances and the covenants offered by his authorized servants then through obedience to those ordinances and covenants their natures would be changed the saviors atonement in that way makes it possible for us to be sanctified we can then live in unity as we must to have peace in this life and to dwell with the father and his son in eternity the ministry of the apostles and prophets in that day as it is today was to bring the children of adam and eve to a unity of the faith in jesus christ the ultimate purpose of what they taught and of what we teach is to unite families husbands wives children grandchildren ancestors and finally all of the family of adam and eve who will choose it you remember the savior prayed for their sakesspeaking of the apostlesi sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth john 1719 the holy ghost is a sanctifier we can have it as our companion because the lord restored the melchizedek priesthood through the prophet joseph smith the keys of that priesthood are on the earth today by its power we can make covenants which allow us to have the holy ghost constantly where people have that spirit with them we may expect harmony the spirit puts the testimony of truth in our hearts which unifies those who share that testimony the spirit of god never generates contention see 3 ne 1129 it never generates the feelings of distinctions between people which lead to strife see joseph f smith gospel doctrine 13th ed 1963 131 it leads to personal peace and a feeling of union with others it unifies souls a unified family a unified church and a world at peace depend on unified souls even a child can understand what to do to have the holy ghost as a companion the sacramental prayer tells us we hear it every week as we attend our sacrament meetings in those sacred moments we renew the covenants we made at baptism and the lord reminds us of the promise we received as we were confirmed members of the churchthe promise that we might receive the holy ghost here are the words of the sacramental prayer they are willing to take upon them the name of thy son and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them that they may always have his spirit to be with them dc 2077 we can have his spirit by keeping that covenant first we promise to take his name upon us that means we must see ourselves as his we will put him first in our lives we will want what he wants rather than what we want or what the world teaches us to want as long as we love the things of the world first there will be no peace in us holding an ideal for a family or a nation of comfort through material goods will at last divide them see harold b lee stand ye in holy places 1974 97 the ideal of doing for each other what the lord would have us do which follows naturally from taking his name upon us can take us to a spiritual level which is a touch of heaven on earth second we promise always to remember him we do that every time we pray in his name especially when we ask for his forgiveness as we must do often we remember him at that moment we remember his sacrifice that makes repentance and forgiveness possible when we plead we remember him as our advocate with the father when the feelings of forgiveness and peace come we remember his patience and his endless love that remembering fills our hearts with love we also keep our promise to remember him when as families we pray together and when we read the scriptures at family prayer around a breakfast table one child may pray for another to be blessed that things will go well that day in a test or in some performance when the blessings come the child blessed will remember the love of the morning and the kindness of the advocate in whose name the prayer was offered hearts will be bound in love we keep our covenant to remember him every time we gather our families to read the scriptures they testify of the lord jesus christ for that is the message and always has been of prophets even if children do not remember the words they will remember the true author who is jesus christ third we promise as we take the sacrament to keep his commandments all of them president j reuben clark jr as he pledas he did many timesfor unity in a general conference talk warned us against being selective in what we will obey he put it this way the lord has given us nothing that is useless or unnecessary he has filled the scriptures with the things which we should do in order that we may gain salvation president clark went on when we partake of the sacrament we covenant to obey and keep his commandments there are no exceptions there are no distinctions no differences in conference report apr 1955 1011 president clark taught that just as we repent of all sin not just a single sin we pledge to keep all the commandments hard as that sounds it is uncomplicated we simply submit to the authority of the savior and promise to be obedient to whatever he commands see mosiah 319 it is our surrender to the authority of jesus christ which will allow us to be bound as families as a church and as the children of our heavenly father the lord conveys that authority through his prophet to humble servants that faith turns our call as a home teacher or a visiting teacher into an errand from the lord we go for him at his command an ordinary man and a teenage junior companion go into homes expecting that the powers of heaven will help them assure that families are united and that there is no hardness lying backbiting nor evil speaking that faiththat the lord calls servantswill help us ignore their limitations when they reprove us as they will we will see their good intent more clearly than their human limitations we will be less likely to feel offense and more likely to feel gratitude to the master who called them there are some commandments which when broken destroy unity some have to do with what we say and some with how we react to what others say we must speak no ill of anyone we must see the good in each other and speak well of each other whenever we can see david o mckay in conference report oct 1967 411 at the same time we must stand against those who speak contemptuously of sacred things because the certain effect of that offense is to offend the spirit and so create contention and confusion president spencer w kimball showed the way to stand without being contentious as he lay on a hospital gurney and asked an attendant who in a moment of frustration took the name of the lord in vain please please that is my lord whose names you revile there was a deathly silence then a subdued voice whispered i am sorry the teachings of spencer w kimball ed edward l kimball 1982 198 an inspired loving rebuke can be an invitation to unity failure to give it when moved upon by the holy ghost will lead to discord if we are to have unity there are commandments we must keep concerning how we feel we must forgive and bear no malice toward those who offend us the savior set the example from the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do luke 2334 we do not know the hearts of those who offend us nor do we know all the sources of our own anger and hurt the apostle paul was telling us how to love in a world of imperfect people including ourselves when he said charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil 1 cor 1345 and then he gave solemn warning against reacting to the fault of others and forgetting our own when he wrote for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as i am known 1 cor 1312 the sacramental prayer can remind us every week of how the gift of unity will come through obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of jesus christ when we keep our covenants to take his name upon us to remember him always and to keep all his commandments we will receive the companionship of his spirit that will soften our hearts and unite us but there are two warnings which must come with that promise first the holy ghost remains with us only if we stay clean and free from the love of the things of the world a choice to be unclean will repel the holy ghost the spirit only dwells with those who choose the lord over the world be ye clean 3 ne 2041 dc 3842 and love god with all your heart might mind and strength dc 595 are not suggestions but commandments and they are necessary to the companionship of the spirit without which we cannot be one the other warning is to beware of pride a unity which comes to a family or to a people softened by the spirit will bring great power with that power will come recognition from the world whether that recognition brings praise or envy it could lead us to pride that would offend the spirit there is a protection against pride that sure source of disunity it is to see the bounties which god pours upon us not only as a mark of his favor but an opportunity to join with those around us in greater service a man and his wife learn to be one by using their similarities to understand each other and their differences to complement each other in serving one another and those around them in the same way we can unite with those who do not accept our doctrine but share our desire to bless the children of our heavenly father we can become peacemakers worthy to be called blessed and the children of god see matt 59 god our father lives his beloved son jesus christ is the head of this church and he offers to all who will accept it the standard of peace i so testify in the sacred name of jesus christ amen
