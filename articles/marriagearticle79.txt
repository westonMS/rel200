covenant marriage by elder bruce c hafen of the seventy imageelder bruce c hafen three summers ago i watched a new bride and groom tracy and tom emerge from a sacred temple they laughed and held hands as family and friends gathered to take pictures i saw happiness and promise in their faces as they greeted their reception guests who celebrated publicly the creation of a new family i wondered that night how long it would be until these two faced the opposition that tests every marriage only then would they discover whether their marriage was based on a contract or a covenant another bride sighed blissfully on her wedding day mom im at the end of all my troubles yes replied her mother but at which end when troubles come the parties to a contractual marriage seek happiness by walking away they marry to obtain benefits and will stay only as long as theyre receiving what they bargained for but when troubles come to a covenant marriage the husband and wife work them through they marry to give and to grow bound by covenants to each other to the community and to god contract companions each give 50 percent covenant companions each give 100 percent1 marriage is by nature a covenant not just a private contract one may cancel at will jesus taught about contractual attitudes when he described the hireling who performs his conditional promise of care only when he receives something in return when the hireling seeth the wolf coming he leaveth the sheep and fleeth because he careth not for the sheep by contrast the savior said i am the good shepherd and i lay down my life for the sheep2 many people today marry as hirelings and when the wolf comes they flee this idea is wrong it curses the earth turning parents hearts away from their children and from each other3 before their marriage tom and tracy received an eternal perspective on covenants and wolves they learned through the story of adam and eve about lifes purpose and how to return to gods presence through obedience and the atonement christs life is the story of giving the atonement the life of adam and eve is the story of receiving the atonement which empowered them to overcome their separation from god and all opposition until they were eternally at one with the lord and with each other without the fall lehi taught adam and eve would never have known opposition and they would have had no children wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence having no joy for they knew no misery4 astute parents will see a little connection hereno children no misery but left in the garden they could never know joy so the lord taught them they would live and bear children in sorrow sweat and thorns still the ground was cursed for their sake5 their path of affliction also led to the joy of both redemption and comprehension6 that is why the husband and wife in a covenant marriage sustain and lift each other when the wolf comes if tom and tracy had understood all this perhaps they would have walked more slowly from the gardenlike temple grounds like adam and eve arm in arm into a harsh and lonely world and yetmarrying and raising children can yield the most valuable religious experiences of their lives covenant marriage requires a total leap of faith they must keep their covenants without knowing what risks that may require of them they must surrender unconditionally obeying god and sacrificing for each other then they will discover what alma called incomprehensible joy7 of course some have no opportunity to marry and some divorces are unavoidable but the lord will ultimately compensate those faithful ones who are denied mortal fulfillment every marriage is tested repeatedly by three kinds of wolves the first wolf is natural adversity after asking god for years to give them a first child david and fran had a baby with a serious heart defect following a threeweek struggle they buried their newborn son like adam and eve before them they mourned together brokenhearted in faith before the lord8 second the wolf of their own imperfections will test them one woman told me through her tears how her husbands constant criticism finally destroyed not only their marriage but her entire sense of selfworth he first complained about her cooking and housecleaning and then about how she used her time how she talked looked and reasoned eventually she felt utterly inept and dysfunctional my heart ached for her and for him contrast her with a young woman who had little selfconfidence when she first married then her husband found so much to praise in her that she gradually began to believe she was a good person and that her opinions mattered his belief in her rekindled her innate selfworth the third wolf is the excessive individualism that has spawned todays contractual attitudes a sevenyearold girl came home from school crying mom dont i belong to you our teacher said today that nobody belongs to anybodychildren dont belong to parents husbands dont belong to wives i am yours arent i mom her mother held her close and whispered of course youre mineand im yours too surely marriage partners must respect one anothers individual identity and family members are neither slaves nor inanimate objects but this teachers fear shared today by many is that the bonds of kinship and marriage are not valuable ties that bind but are instead sheer bondage ours is the age of the waning of belonging the adversary has long cultivated this overemphasis on personal autonomy and now he feverishly exploits it our deepest godgiven instinct is to run to the arms of those who need us and sustain us but he drives us away from each other today with wedges of distrust and suspicion he exaggerates the need for having space getting out and being left alone some people believe himand then they wonder why they feel left alone and despite admirable exceptions children in americas growing number of singleparent families are clearly more at risk than children in twoparent families9 further the rates of divorce and births outside marriage are now so high that we may be witnessing the collapse of marriage10 many people even wonder these days what marriage is should we prohibit samesex marriage should we make divorce more difficult to obtain some say these questions are not societys business because marriage is a private contract but as the modern prophets recently proclaimed marriage is ordained of god11 even secular marriage was historically a threeparty covenant among a man a woman and the state society has a huge interest in the outcome and the offspring of every marriage so the public nature of marriage distinguishes it from all other relationships guests come to weddings because as wendell berry said sweethearts say their vows to the community as much as to one another giving themselves not only to each other but also to the common good as no contract could ever join them12 when we observe the covenants we make at the altar of sacrifice we discover hidden reservoirs of strength i once said in exasperation to my wife marie the lord placed adam and eve on the earth as fullgrown people why couldnt he have done that with this boy of ours the one with the freckles and the unruly hair she replied the lord gave us that child to make christians out of us one night marie exhausted herself for hours encouraging that child to finish a school assignment to build his own diorama of a native american village on a cookie sheet it was a test no hireling would have endured at first he fought her efforts but by bedtime i saw him lay his diorama proudly on a counter he started for his bed then turned around raced back across the room and hugged his mother grinning with his fourthgrade teeth later i asked marie in complete awe how did you do it she said i just made up my mind that i couldnt leave him no matter what then she added i didnt know i had it in me she discovered deep internal wellsprings of compassion because the bonds of her covenants gave her strength to lay down her life for her sheep even an hour at a time now i return to tom and tracy who this year discovered wellsprings of their own their second baby threatened to come too early to live they might have made a hirelings convenient choice and gone on with their lives letting a miscarriage occur but because they tried to observe their covenants by sacrifice13 active energetic tracy lay almost motionless at home for five weeks then in a hospital bed for another five tom was with her virtually every hour when he was not working or sleeping they prayed their child to earth then the baby required 11 more weeks in the hospital but she is here and she is theirs one night as tracy waited patiently upon the lord in the hospital she sensed that perhaps her willingness to sacrifice herself for her baby was in some small way like the good shepherds sacrifice for her she said i had expected that trying to give so much would be really difficult but somehow this felt more like a privilege as many other parents in zion have done she and tom gave their hearts to god by giving them to their child in the process they learned that theirs is a covenant marriage one that binds them to each other and to the lord may we restore the concept of marriage as a covenant even the new and everlasting covenant of marriage14 and when the wolf comes may we be as shepherds not hirelings willing to lay down our lives a day at a time for the sheep of our covenant then like adam and eve we will have joy15 in the name of jesus christ amen
