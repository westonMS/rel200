children of the covenant by elder russell m nelson of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder russell m nelson the title of my message is the scriptural phrase children of the covenant1 in introducing this topic i will reflect on recent events as a colleague of president howard w hunter and as a father and upon earlier experiences as a doctor of medicine these past weeks have been challenging for sister nelson and me not only have we bid farewell to our beloved president hunter but thirtythree days earlier we suffered the demise of our precious daughter emily a mother of five young children emily had just celebrated her thirtyseventh birthday when called to the other side president hunter influenced emilys life in a real way she welcomed his invitation for all adult members of the church to hold a temple recommend she and her husband bradley wittwer regarded their regular time in the temple as a sacred privilege they viewed the temple of the lord as the great symbol of their membership and the supernal setting for their most sacred covenants she strived to emulate the example of the lord jesus christ2 even though illness brought intense suffering to president hunter and emily an angry word never fell from their lips instead they chose to endure with loving faith when wellmeaning friends and family expressed concern for emily she cheerfully replied dont worry ill be ok even when she concluded a telephone call she did not close with the customary goodbye she would say i love you when president boyd k packer and i last visited president hunter he beckoned for sister hunter reached for her hand and said with a smile i feel better when you are near me my tears of sorrow have flowed along with wishes that i could have done more for our daughter and for our president if i had the power of resurrection i would have been tempted to bring them back though one of the ordained apostles each of whom is entrusted with all the keys of the kingdom of god i do not hold keys of the resurrection jesus christ holds those keys and will use them for emily for president hunter and for all people in the lords own time3 emily and president hunter had no fear of death they had made and honored sacred covenants with the lord and they knew that his covenants to them will be kept with equal fidelity4 they lived nobly as children of the covenant years ago as a young medical student i saw many patients afflicted with diseases that are now preventable today it is possible to immunize individuals against conditions that once were disablingeven deadly one medical method by which acquired immunity is conferred is inoculation the term inoculate is fascinating it comes from two latin roots in meaning within and oculus meaning an eye the verb to inoculate therefore literally means to put an eye withinto monitor against harm an affliction like polio can cripple or destroy the body an affliction like sin can cripple or destroy the spirit the ravages of polio can now be prevented by immunization but the ravages of sin require other means of prevention doctors cannot immunize against iniquity spiritual protection comes only from the lord5and in his own way jesus chooses not to inoculate but to indoctrinate his method employs no vaccine it utilizes the teaching of divine doctrinea governing eye withinto protect the eternal spirits of his children identification and indoctrination in so teaching jesus often established his own identity6 then the identity of his followers i quote his words to the people of ancient america he said i am jesus christ the son of god7 all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after have testified of me and behold ye are the children of the prophets and ye are of the house of israel and ye are of the covenant which the father made with your fathers saying unto abraham and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed the father having raised me up unto you first and sent me to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities and this because ye are the children of the covenant8 a giant step toward spiritual immunity is taken when we understand the expression children of the covenant to what covenant did the savior refer the covenant which he made with abraham9 the lord added i will remember the covenant which i have made with my people and i have covenanted with them that i would gather them together in mine own due time10 the abrahamic covenant the covenant that the lord first made to abraham11 and reaffirmed to isaac12 and jacob13 is of transcendent significance it contained several promises abrahams posterity would be numerous entitled to eternal increase and to bear the priesthood he would become a father of many nations christ and kings would come through abrahams lineage certain lands would be inherited all nations of the earth would be blessed by his seed that covenant would be everlastingeven through a thousand generations14 some of these promises have been accomplished others have yet to be i quote from a prophecy given nearly 600 years bc our father hath not spoken of our seed alone but also of all the house of israel pointing to the covenant which should be fulfilled in the latter days which covenant the lord made to our father abraham15 precisely as promised the master appeared in these latter days to renew the abrahamic covenant to the prophet joseph smith the lord declared abraham received promises concerning his seed and of the fruit of his loinsfrom whose loins ye are my servant joseph this promise is yours also because ye are of abraham16 we are also children of the covenant we have received as did they of old the holy priesthood and the everlasting gospel abraham isaac and jacob are our ancestors we are of israel we have the right to receive the gospel blessings of the priesthood and eternal life nations of the earth will be blessed by our efforts and by the labors of our posterity the literal seed of abraham and those who are gathered into his family by adoption receive these promised blessingspredicated upon acceptance of the lord and obedience to his commandments elijah the prophet came to plant a knowledge of these promises made to the fathers17 later the book of mormon came forth as a sign that the lord had commenced to gather children of the covenant18 this book written for our day states then ye may know that the covenant which the father hath made with the children of israel is already beginning to be fulfilled for behold the lord will remember his covenant which he hath made unto his people of the house of israel19 the new and everlasting covenant indeed the lord has not forgotten us and to ensure that we do not forget him children of the covenant receive his doctrine and claim it by covenant brigham young said all latterday saints enter the new and everlasting covenant when they enter this church they enter the new and everlasting covenant to sustain the kingdom of god and no other kingdom20 at baptism we covenant to serve the lord and keep his commandments when we partake of the sacrament we renew those covenants we may receive covenants of the priesthood21 and the crowning blessings of the endowment the doctrine and the covenants unique to the holy temple the new and everlasting covenant of the gospel allows us to qualify for marriage in the temple and be blessed to come forth in the first resurrection and inherit thrones kingdoms principalities and powers dominions to our exaltation and glory in all things22 children born to parents thus married are natural heirs to the blessings of the priesthood they are born in the covenant hence they require no rite of adoption or sealing to insure them place in the posterity of promise23 rewards for obedience to the commandments are almost beyond mortal comprehension here children of the covenant become a strain of sinresistant souls and hereafter president hunter emily other children of the covenant and each generation would be linked to the one which went on before in the divine family of god24 great comfort comes from the knowledge that our loved ones are secured to us through the covenants unity among children of the covenant latterday saints understand the word of the lord who declared i say unto you be one and if ye are not one ye are not mine25 this great unity is the hallmark of the true church of christ said president gordon b hinckley it is felt among our people throughout the world president hinckley continued we pray for one another that we may go on in unity and strength26 throughout the world however strident voices are engaged in divisive disputation and namecalling often demeaning nicknames are added toor even substituted forgiven names unfortunately terms of derision obscure the true identity of children of the covenant in contrast god employs names that unify and sanctify when we embrace the gospel and are baptized we are born again and take upon ourselves the sacred name of jesus christ27 we are adopted as his sons and daughters and are known as brothers and sisters he is the father of our new life we become joint heirs to promises given by the lord to abraham isaac jacob and their posterity28 peter used uplifting terms in a prophecy regarding our day he identified members of the church as a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people29 the adjectives chosen royal and holy we recognize as elevating but what about peculiar a modern dictionary defines peculiar as unusual eccentric or strange30 what kind of compliment is that but the term peculiar as used in the scriptures is quite different in the old testament the hebrew term from which peculiar was translated is segullah which means valued property or treasure31 in the new testament the greek term from which peculiar was translated is peripoiesis which means possession or an obtaining32 thus we see that the scriptural term peculiar signifies valued treasure made or selected by god33 for us to be identified by servants of the lord as his peculiar people is a compliment of the highest order when we know who we are and what god expects of uswhen his law is written in our hearts34we are spiritually protected we become better people when the nephites were truly righteous they avoided divisive nicknames and there was no contention in the land because of the love of god which did dwell in the hearts of the people35 there were no lamanites nor any manner of ites but they were in one the children of christ and heirs to the kingdom of god36 that lesson from history suggests that we also delete from our personal vocabularies names that segregate and hyphens that separate paul taught that there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus37 he invites us to come unto him and partake of his goodness and he denieth none that come unto him black and white bond and free male and female all are alike unto god38 the church of jesus christ of latterday saints has been restored in these latter days to fulfill ancient promises of the lord it is part of the restitution of all things39 committed children of the covenant remain steadfast even in the midst of adversity we shall be chastened and tried even as abraham who was commanded to offer up his only son40 yet we are strengthened by this promise of the lord ye are lawful heirs according to the flesh and have been hid from the world with christ in god therefore your life and the priesthood have remained and must needs remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things therefore blessed are ye if ye continue in my goodness a light unto the gentiles and through this priesthood a savior unto my people israel41 with that doctrine implanted deeply within our souls the sting of death is soothed and spiritual protection is provided children of the covenant will be blessedhere and hereafteri testify in the name of jesus christ amen notes 3 ne 2026 howard w hunter quoted in ensign july 1994 pp 45 see

old and new cities of jerusalem for example then shall this covenant which the father hath covenanted with his people be fulfilled and then shall jerusalem be inhabited again with my people and it shall be the land of their inheritance 3 ne 2046 and that it was the place of the new jerusalem which should come down out of heaven and the holy sanctuary of the lord behold ether saw the days of christ and he spake concerning a new jerusalem upon this land and he spake also concerning the house of israel and the jerusalem from whence lehi should comeafter it should be destroyed it should be built up again a holy city unto the lord wherefore it could not be a new jerusalem for it had been in a time of old but it should be built up again and become a holy city of the lord and it should be built unto the house of israel and that a new jerusalem should be built up upon this land unto the remnant of the seed of joseph for which things there has been a type ether 1336 discourses of brigham

selection of a marriage partner on the other hand involves specific and not general criteria after all one person can only be married to one individual the probabilities of a successful marriage are known to be much greater if both the husband and wife are united in their religion language culture and ethnic background thus in choosing an eternal companion wisdom is needed its better not to fly in the face of constant head winds occasional squalls provide challenge enough once marriage vows are taken absolute fidelity is essentialto the lord and to ones companion acts 321 dc 1014 dc 86911
