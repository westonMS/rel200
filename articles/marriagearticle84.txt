stand ye in holy places by elder lance b wickman of the seventy imageelder lance b wickman i shall never forget one night almost three decades ago my bride patricia and i had been married for two years we lived in a small duplex on oahus north shore i was an army infantry officer a platoon leader assigned to a unit at schofield barracks hawaii our brigade had been ordered to war in vietnam my plane was scheduled for departure after midnight and a good latterday saint friend had agreed to take me to the airfield at 1100 pm all through that long evening pat and i sat on the sofa in our tiny living room with our fingers intertwined watching the hands of the clock approach the fateful hour and listening to the soft lapping of the surf against the shore the ticking of the clock seemed a metronome of mortality in painful contrast to the muffled rushing of the eternal sea at last the hour of parting arrived inside the doorway to our little home i clutched my bride to my bosom and kissed her one last time and then i was gone as i closed the door i wondered if i had seen my sweetheart for the last time in mortality it was truly night my friend and i drove silently in the darkness through the sugarcane and pineapple fields of oahu my heart felt as though it would break then as we passed schofield an unseen infantry unit on night maneuvers fired a flare its brilliance momentarily lit the inky darkness and seemed to ignite a spiritual flame in the blackness that invested my soul my thoughts were drawn away from this saddest of days to the very happiest back to that beautiful december day when pat and i had entered the holy temple and there were sealed to each other not just for this life only but for all eternity i thought of the eternal covenants we had made like the sunrise it dawned on me that no matter what happened in the uncertain future just ahead pat would always be mine when i reached the air base i telephoned her in the spirit of a renewed hope and peace born of faith and understanding we talked and laughed softly before once more bidding each other goodbye it was only midnight but for me the sun was already rising on another day in another place however the sun was setting on the mortal ministry of the messiah as he departed the temple at jerusalem for the last time climbing atop the mount of olives with his disciples the savior prophesied the cataclysmic events that would precede the destruction of jerusalem and his second coming he then issued this portentous admonition to his disciples ancient and modern then you shall stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand jsm 112 emphasis added see also matt 2415 latterday revelations provide understanding they teach that in our day amidst strife and catastrophe and pestilence there are two kingdoms locked in grim struggle for the souls of menzion and babylon more than once they repeat the injunction to stand in holy places for a refuge from these storms of latterday life dc 4532 see also dc 878 dc 1011623 prominent among such holy places and key to all the others is the temple of the lord the words zion and temple belong in the same sentence together in august 1833 as saints attempted against much persecution to establish a geographic zion in jackson county missouri the prophet joseph smith was counseled in revelation to build a house unto the lord for the salvation of zion dc 9712 the temple is the key to salvation it said because it is a place of thanksgiving a place of instruction and a place of understanding in all things see dc 971214 then comes this glorious promise yea and my presence shall be there for i will come into it and all the pure in heart that shall come into it shall see god therefore let zion rejoice for this is zionthe pure in heart therefore let zion rejoice while all the wicked shall mourn dc 9716 21 emphasis added for zion the pure in heart the temple holds the key that unlocks holy placesplaces of rejoicingwhile those in babylons byways are condemned to mourn i was to bid my dear wife goodbye twice more during the tumultuous years of the vietnam war in a later year we would stand together and say farewell as a fiveyearold son slipped from this world across the veiled threshold into the next and later still we would welcome a handicapped daughter into mortality life has brought us its challenges as it does to all but through the years i have come to appreciate the wisdom of a dear friend a patriarch and temple sealer lance he said the joy i receive is more than just being in the temple the temple is in me and when i leave the temple its peace goes with me so it can be for every righteous soul when we visit the temple as often as distance and individual circumstance permit the temple will be in us then despite the buffetings of life we will always be in a holy place the house of the lord beckons to all who would be numbered with zion come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths isa 23 the day of the san diego california temple dedication attended by our stake i came into the celestial room a few minutes early accompanied by my daughter and one of my sons my dear pat was directing the choir as though joined by angels they rehearsed these magnificent words from a beloved latterday saint hymna hymn we sang only moments ago high on the mountain top a banner is unfurled ye nations now look up it waves to all the world in deserets sweet peaceful land on zions mount behold it stand hymns 1985 no 5 pats eyes met mine for a brief moment i was transported back across the years past the challenges and the heartaches to that wonderful day when together we had entered the house of the lord i drew my children close in that instant a wonderful celestial feeling swelled my breast i knew i was in a holy place i felt a peace as i had on that dark night so many years agoand again i rejoiced in the name of jesus christ amen
