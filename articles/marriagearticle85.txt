making the right choices by elder richard g scott of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder richard g scott present tonight are many young men who hold the priesthood of god1 some of you look forward to being a missionary when you are older others are planning to go soon still others have completed missions and are seeking an eternal companion i am sobered by the realization that some of you will not reach these worthy goals because of other choices you are making now i am grateful this is a private priesthood meeting for i have felt impressed to treat sensitive yet important matters while they apply to all present i particularly want to talk with you young men i will speak as though you and i were alone in a private interview and no one else can hear us my purpose is to help you learn how to make the right choices that will help you develop strong feelings of selfworth you will have confidence to do right and overcome strong negative peer pressure and bad influences as a young boy i felt that some things that i heard discussed by others at school about private parts of the body were wrong yet i wasnt really sure how wrong or why they were wrong you may have similar feelings since in tonights setting you cannot ask me anything i will use some of the confidential questions most frequently asked by youth i have met across the world i will answer them by what i have learned from the scriptures and the prophets you then will have clear standards from which to make choices i pray that as we talk the holy ghost will let you feel the truth of what is said i know that as you listen and think of how our interview applies to you there will come impressions regarding what to do about it in your own life question could you give us some help about resisting peer pressure why do some people do things that are wrong then brag about how much fun they are having when i dont participate they make me feel stupid because i wont do it answer you cant please god without upsetting satan so you will get pressure from those he tempts to do wrong individuals who do wrong want you to join them because they feel more comfortable in what they are doing when others do it also they may also want to take advantage of you it is natural to want to be accepted by peers to be part of a groupsome even join gangs because of that desire to belong but they lose their freedom and some lose their lives one of the hardest things for you to recognize is how truly strong you already are and how others silently respect you we have great confidence in you you dont need to compromise your standards to be accepted by good friends the more obedient you are the more you stand for true principles the more the lord can help you overcome temptation2 you can also help others because they will feel your strength let them know about your standards by consistently living them answer questions about your principles when you are asked but avoid being preachy i know from personal experience that works no one intends to make serious mistakes they come when you compromise your standards to be more accepted by others you be the strong one you be the leader choose good friends and resist peer pressure together question how do we keep bad thoughts from entering our minds and what do we do when they come answer some bad thoughts come by themselves others come because we invite them by what we look at and listen to3 talking about or looking at immodest pictures of a womans body can stimulate powerful emotions it will tempt you to watch improper videocassettes or movies these things surround you but you must not participate in them work at keeping your thoughts clean by thinking of something good4 the mind can think of only one thing at a time use that fact to crowd out ugly thoughts5 above all dont feed thoughts by reading or watching things that are wrong if you dont control your thoughts satan will keep tempting you until you eventually act them out6 question why is the law of chastity so important why is sex before marriage wrong answer fundamental to the great plan of happiness and central to the teachings of the savior is the family a new family begins when a man and woman make sacred marriage vows and are legally bound together to become husband and wife father and mother the perfect beginning is through sealing in the temple with marriage they commit the best of themselves to be absolutely loyal to each other and to invite children to be nurtured and taught the father assumes his role as provider and protector the mother her role as the heart of the home with her tender loving nurturing influence together they strive to instill in themselves and their children principles such as prayer obedience love giving of oneself and the quest for knowledge within the enduring covenant of marriage the lord permits husband and wife the expression of the sacred procreative powers in all their loveliness and beauty within the bounds he has set7 one purpose of this private sacred intimate experience is to provide the physical bodies for the spirits father in heaven wants to experience mortality another reason for these powerful and beautiful feelings of love is to bind husband and wife together in loyalty fidelity consideration of each other and common purpose however those intimate acts are forbidden by the lord outside the enduring commitment of marriage because they undermine his purposes8 within the sacred covenant of marriage such relationships are according to his plan when experienced any other way they are against his will they cause serious emotional and spiritual harm even though participants do not realize that is happening now they will later sexual immorality creates a barrier to the influence of the holy spirit with all its uplifting enlightening and empowering capabilities it causes powerful physical and emotional stimulation in time that creates an unquenchable appetite that drives the offender to ever more serious sin it engenders selfishness and can produce aggressive acts such as brutality abortion sexual abuse and violent crime such stimulation can lead to acts of homosexuality and they are evil and absolutely wrong9 sexual transgression would defile the priesthood you now hold sap your spiritual strength undermine your faith in jesus christ and frustrate your ability to serve him consistent willing obedience increases your confidence and ability it produces character that allows you to face difficult challenges and overcome them it qualifies you to receive inspiration and power from the lord10 question they always tell us we shouldnt become sexually involved but they never tell us the limits what are they answer any sexual intimacy outside of the bonds of marriagei mean any intentional contact with the sacred private parts of anothers body with or without clothingis a sin and is forbidden by god it is also a transgression to intentionally stimulate these emotions within your own body11 satan tempts one to believe that there are allowable levels of physical contact between consenting individuals who seek the powerful stimulation of emotions they produce and if kept within bounds no harm will result as a witness of jesus christ i testify that is absolutely false satan particularly seeks to tempt one who has lived a pure clean life to experiment through magazines videocassettes or movies with powerful images of a womans body he wants to stimulate appetite to cause experimentation that quickly results in intimacies and defilement powerful habits are formed which are difficult to break mental and emotional scars result when you are mature enough to plan seriously for marriage keep your expressions of feelings to those that are comfortable in the presence of your parents12 to help you keep these sacred commandments make a covenant with the lord that you will obey them decide what you will do and will not do when temptation comes do not change your standards do not abandon them when circumstances seem to justify an exception that is satans way to hurt you by making it seem that sometimes gods law does not apply there are no exceptions question before you are married how far is too far to go if it is with your girlfriend answer before marriage there can be no sexual contact with a girlfriend fianc√©e or anyone else period13 while a commandment that standard is for your happiness thats why the church counsels you to go in groups and not to date while you are young later as you prepare for marriage remember that true love elevates protects respects and enriches another it motivates you to make sacrifices for the girl you love satan would promote counterfeit love which is really lust that is driven by hunger to satisfy personal appetite protect the one you love by controlling your emotions to the limits set by the lord you know how to be clean we trust you to do it question how do you go about repenting after a sexual sin is committed what sins should you tell the bishop answer all of the sexual transgressions we have discussed require sincere repentance with the participation of the bishop should you have done any of this repent now it is wrong to violate these commandments of the lord it is worse to do nothing about it sin is like cancer in the body it will never heal itself it will become worse unless cured through repentance your parents can help strengthen you then you can become clean and pure by repentance under the guidance of the bishop he may seem to be busy or unavailable tell him you are in trouble and need help he will listen a youth in serious trouble said i have done things that i knew were bad i have been taught they were ever since i can remember i know repentance is a great gift without it i would be lost but im not ready to repent of my sins yet i know when i am ready i can how tragic the thought of intentionally committing serious sin now and repenting later is perilously wrong never do that14 many start that journey of intentional transgression and never make it back premeditated sin has greater penalties and is harder to overcome if there is sin repent nowwhile you can i pray that as we have talked you have had feelings to do better15 you hold the priesthood of god that is a sacred responsibility16 and also a singular privilege17 you will be fortified in your determination to live righteously as you study the scriptures especially the book of mormon listen to your parents leaders and the prophet we have sustained today have faith in the savior he will help you18 remember he said i the lord am bound when ye do what i say but when ye do not what i say ye have no promise19 please stay morally clean the lord will make that possible as you do your part with all your strength20 jesus christ lives and he loves you he will help you as you do your part in the name of jesus christ amen notes see discourses of wilford woodruff sel g homer
