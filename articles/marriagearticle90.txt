the great plan of happiness by elder dallin h oaks of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder dallin h oaks questions like where did we come from why are we here and where are we going are answered in the gospel of jesus christ prophets have called it the plan of salvation and the great plan of happiness alma 428 through inspiration we can understand this road map of eternity and use it to guide our path in mortality the gospel teaches us that we are the spirit children of heavenly parents before our mortal birth we had a preexistent spiritual personality as the sons and daughters of the eternal father statement of the first presidency improvement era mar 1912 p 417 also see jer 15 we were placed here on earth to progress toward our destiny of eternal life these truths give us a unique perspective and different values to guide our decisions from those who doubt the existence of god and believe that life is the result of random processes our understanding of life begins with a council in heaven there the spirit children of god were taught his eternal plan for their destiny we had progressed as far as we could without a physical body and an experience in mortality to realize a fulness of joy we had to prove our willingness to keep the commandments of god in a circumstance where we had no memory of what preceded our mortal birth in the course of mortality we would become subject to death and we would be soiled by sin to reclaim us from death and sin our heavenly fathers plan provided us a savior whose atonement would redeem all from death and pay the price necessary for all to be cleansed from sin on the conditions he prescribed see 2 ne 91924 satan had his own plan he proposed to save all the spirit children of god assuring that result by removing their power to choose and thus eliminating the possibility of sin when satans plan was rejected he and the spirits who followed him opposed the fathers plan and were cast out all of the myriads of mortals who have been born on this earth chose the fathers plan and fought for it many of us also made covenants with the father concerning what we would do in mortality in ways that have not been revealed our actions in the spirit world influence us in mortality although satan and his followers have lost their opportunity to have a physical body they are permitted to use their spirit powers to try to frustrate gods plan this provides the opposition necessary to test how mortals will use their freedom to choose satans most strenuous opposition is directed at whatever is most important to the fathers plan satan seeks to discredit the savior and divine authority to nullify the effects of the atonement to counterfeit revelation to lead people away from the truth to contradict individual accountability to confuse gender to undermine marriage and to discourage childbearing especially by parents who will raise children in righteousness maleness and femaleness marriage and the bearing and nurturing of children are all essential to the great plan of happiness modern revelation makes clear that what we call gender was part of our existence prior to our birth god declares that he created male and female dc 2018 moses 227 gen 127 elder james e talmage explained the distinction between male and female is no condition peculiar to the relatively brief period of mortal life it was an essential characteristic of our preexistent condition millennial star 24 aug 1922 p 539 to the first man and woman on earth the lord said be fruitful and multiply moses 228 see also gen 128 abr 428 this commandment was first in sequence and first in importance it was essential that gods spirit children have mortal birth and an opportunity to progress toward eternal life consequently all things related to procreation are prime targets for the adversarys efforts to thwart the plan of god when adam and eve received the first commandment they were in a transitional state no longer in the spirit world but with physical bodies not yet subject to death and not yet capable of procreation they could not fulfill the fathers first commandment without transgressing the barrier between the bliss of the garden of eden and the terrible trials and wonderful opportunities of mortal life for reasons that have not been revealed this transition or fall could not happen without a transgressionan exercise of moral agency amounting to a willful breaking of a law see moses 659 this would be a planned offense a formality to serve an eternal purpose the prophet lehi explained that if adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen 2 ne 222 but would have remained in the same state in which he was created and they would have had no children wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence having no joy for they knew no misery doing no good for they knew no sin 2 ne 223 but the fall was planned lehi concludes because all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things 2 ne 224 it was eve who first transgressed the limits of eden in order to initiate the conditions of mortality her act whatever its nature was formally a transgression but eternally a glorious necessity to open the doorway toward eternal life adam showed his wisdom by doing the same and thus eve and adam fell that men might be 2 ne 225 some christians condemn eve for her act concluding that she and her daughters are somehow flawed by it not the latterday saints informed by revelation we celebrate eves act and honor her wisdom and courage in the great episode called the fall see bruce r mcconkie eve and the fall woman salt lake city deseret book co 1979 pp 6768 joseph smith taught that it was not a sin because god had decreed it see the words of joseph smith ed andrew f ehat and lyndon w cook provo utah religious studies center brigham young university 1980 p 63 brigham young declared we should never blame mother eve not the least in journal of discourses 13145 elder joseph fielding smith said i never speak of the part eve took in this fall as a sin nor do i accuse adam of a sin this was a transgression of the law but not a sin for it was something that adam and eve had to do joseph fielding smith doctrines of salvation comp bruce r mcconkie 3 vols salt lake city bookcraft 195456 111415 this suggested contrast between a sin and a transgression reminds us of the careful wording in the second article of faith we believe that men will be punished for their own sins and not for adams transgression emphasis added it also echoes a familiar distinction in the law some acts like murder are crimes because they are inherently wrong other acts like operating without a license are crimes only because they are legally prohibited under these distinctions the act that produced the fall was not a sininherently wrongbut a transgressionwrong because it was formally prohibited these words are not always used to denote something different but this distinction seems meaningful in the circumstances of the fall modern revelation shows that our first parents understood the necessity of the fall adam declared blessed be the name of god for because of my transgression my eyes are opened and in this life i shall have joy and again in the flesh i shall see god moses 510 note the different perspective and the special wisdom of eve who focused on the purpose and effect of the great plan of happiness were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed and never should have known good and evil and the joy of our redemption and the eternal life which god giveth unto all the obedient moses 511 in his vision of the redemption of the dead president joseph f smith saw the great and mighty ones assembled to meet the son of god and among them was our glorious mother eve dc 1383839 when we understand the plan of salvation we also understand the purpose and effect of the commandments god has given his children he teaches us correct principles and invites us to govern ourselves we do this by the choices we make in mortality we live in a day when there are many political legal and social pressures for changes that confuse gender and homogenize the differences between men and women our eternal perspective sets us against changes that alter those separate duties and privileges of men and women that are essential to accomplish the great plan of happiness we do not oppose all changes in the treatment of men and women since some changes in laws or customs simply correct old wrongs that were never grounded in eternal principles the power to create mortal life is the most exalted power god has given his children its use was mandated in the first commandment but another important commandment was given to forbid its misuse the emphasis we place on the law of chastity is explained by our understanding of the purpose of our procreative powers in the accomplishment of gods plan the expression of our procreative powers is pleasing to god but he has commanded that this be confined within the relationship of marriage president spencer w kimball taught that in the context of lawful marriage the intimacy of sexual relations is right and divinely approved there is nothing unholy or degrading about sexuality in itself for by that means men and women join in a process of creation and in an expression of love the teachings of spencer w kimball ed edward l kimball salt lake city bookcraft 1982 p 311 outside the bonds of marriage all uses of the procreative power are to one degree or another a sinful degrading and perversion of the most divine attribute of men and women the book of mormon teaches that unchastity is most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the holy ghost alma 395 in our own day the first presidency of the church has declared the doctrine of this church that sexual sinthe illicit sexual relations of men and womenstands in its enormity next to murder message of the first presidency 3 oct 1942 as quoted in messages of the first presidency of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints comp james r clark 6 vols salt lake city bookcraft 196575 6176 some who do not know the plan of salvation behave like promiscuous animals but latterday saintsespecially those who are under sacred covenantshave no such latitude we are solemnly responsible to god for the destruction or misuse of the creative powers he has placed within us the ultimate act of destruction is to take a life that is why abortion is such a serious sin our attitude toward abortion is not based on revealed knowledge of when mortal life begins for legal purposes it is fixed by our knowledge that according to an eternal plan all of the spirit children of god must come to this earth for a glorious purpose and that individual identity began long before conception and will continue for all the eternities to come we rely on the prophets of god who have told us that while there may be rare exceptions the practice of elective abortion is fundamentally contrary to the lords injunction thou shalt not kill nor do anything like unto it dc 596 1991 supplement to the 1989 general handbook of instructions p 1 our knowledge of the great plan of happiness also gives us a unique perspective on the subject of marriage and the bearing of children in this we also run counter to some strong current forces in custom law and economics marriage is disdained by an increasing number of couples and many who marry choose to forgo children or place severe limits on their number in recent years strong economic pressures in many nations have altered the traditional assumption of a single breadwinner per family increases in the number of working mothers of young children inevitably signal a reduced commitment of parental time to nurturing the young the effect of these reductions is evident in the rising numbers of abortions divorces child neglect and juvenile crime we are taught that marriage is necessary for the accomplishment of gods plan to provide the approved setting for mortal birth and to prepare family members for eternal life marriage is ordained of god unto man the lord said that the earth might answer the end of its creation and that it might be filled with the measure of man according to his creation before the world was made dc 491517 our concept of marriage is motivated by revealed truth not by worldly sociology the apostle paul taught neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord 1 cor 1111 president spencer w kimball explained without proper and successful marriage one will never be exalted marriage and divorce salt lake city deseret book co 1976 p 24 according to custom men are expected to take the initiative in seeking marriage that is why president joseph f smith directed his prophetic pressure at men he said no man who is marriageable is fully living his religion who remains unmarried gospel doctrine salt lake city deseret book co 1939 p 275 we hear of some worthy lds men in their thirties who are busy accumulating property and enjoying freedom from family responsibilities without any sense of urgency about marriage beware brethren you are deficient in a sacred duty knowledge of the great plan of happiness also gives latterday saints a distinctive attitude toward the bearing and nurturing of children in some times and places children have been regarded as no more than laborers in a family economic enterprise or as insurers of support for their parents though repelled by these repressions some persons in our day have no compunctions against similar attitudes that subordinate the welfare of a spirit child of god to the comfort or convenience of parents the savior taught that we should not lay up treasures on earth but should lay up treasures in heaven see matt 61921 in light of the ultimate purpose of the great plan of happiness i believe that the ultimate treasures on earth and in heaven are our children and our posterity president kimball said it is an act of extreme selfishness for a married couple to refuse to have children when they are able to do so ensign may 1979 p 6 when married couples postpone childbearing until after they have satisfied their material goals the mere passage of time assures that they seriously reduce their potential to participate in furthering our heavenly fathers plan for all of his spirit children faithful latterday saints cannot afford to look upon children as an interference with what the world calls selffulfillment our covenants with god and the ultimate purpose of life are tied up in those little ones who reach for our time our love and our sacrifices how many children should a couple have all they can care for of course to care for children means more than simply giving them life children must be loved nurtured taught fed clothed housed and well started in their capacities to be good parents themselves exercising faith in gods promises to bless them when they are keeping his commandments many lds parents have large families others seek but are not blessed with children or with the number of children they desire in a matter as intimate as this we should not judge one another president gordon b hinckley gave this inspired counsel to an audience of young latterday saints i like to think of the positive side of the equation of the meaning and sanctity of life of the purpose of this estate in our eternal journey of the need for the experiences of mortal life under the great plan of god our father of the joy that is to be found only where there are children in the home of the blessings that come of good posterity when i think of these values and see them taught and observed then i am willing to leave the question of numbers to the man and the woman and the lord if i were you what would i do brigham young university 198384 fireside and devotional speeches provo utah university publications 1984 p 11 some who are listening to this message are probably saying but what about me we know that many worthy and wonderful latterday saints currently lack the ideal opportunities and essential requirements for their progress singleness childlessness death and divorce frustrate ideals and postpone the fulfillment of promised blessings in addition some women who desire to be fulltime mothers and homemakers have been literally compelled to enter the fulltime work force but these frustrations are only temporary the lord has promised that in the eternities no blessing will be denied his sons and daughters who keep the commandments are true to their covenants and desire what is right many of the most important deprivations of mortality will be set right in the millennium which is the time for fulfilling all that is incomplete in the great plan of happiness for all of our fathers worthy children we know that will be true of temple ordinances i believe it will also be true of family relationships and experiences i pray that we will not let the challenges and temporary diversions of mortality cause us to forget our covenants and lose sight of our eternal destiny we who know gods plan for his children we who have covenanted to participate have a clear responsibility we must desire to do what is right and we must do all that we can in our own circumstances in mortality in all of this we should remember king benjamins caution to see that all these things are done in wisdom and order for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength mosiah 427 i think of that inspired teaching whenever i feel inadequate frustrated or depressed when we have done all that we are able we can rely on gods promised mercy we have a savior who has taken upon him not just the sins but also the pains and the sicknesses of his people that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities alma 71112 he is our savior and when we have done all that we can he will make up the difference in his own way and in his own time of that i testify in the name of jesus christ amen
