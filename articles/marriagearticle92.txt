our moral environment by elder boyd k packer of the quorum of the twelve apostles imageelder boyd k packer i have been a general authority for over thirty years and a member of the quorum of the twelve apostles for twentytwo during those years i have interviewed i dont know how many surely thousands of members of the church and have talked with them in intimate terms of their worthiness their sorrow and their happiness i only mention that in the hope that the credential of experience may persuade you to consider matters which have us deeply worried moral environment today i speak to members of the church as an environmentalist my message is not on the physical but on the moral and spiritual environment in which we must raise our families as we test the moral environment we find the pollution index is spiraling upward the book of mormon depicts humanity struggling through a mist of darkness and defines the darkness as the temptations of the devil 1 ne 823 1 ne 1217 so dense was that moral pollution that many followed strange roads and fell away into forbidden paths and were lost see 1 ne 82332 the deliberate pollution of the fountain of life now clouds our moral environment the gift of mortal life and the capacity to kindle other lives is a supernal blessing its worth is incalculable the spiritual environment the rapid sweeping deterioration of values is characterized by a preoccupationeven an obsessionwith the procreative act abstinence before marriage and fidelity within it are openly scoffed atmarriage and parenthood ridiculed as burdensome unnecessary modesty a virtue of a refined individual or society is all but gone the tempter the adversary is jealous toward all who have the power to beget life he cannot beget life he is impotent he and those who followed him were cast out and forfeited the right to a mortal body his angels even begged to inhabit the bodies of swine see matt 831 and the revelations tell us that he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself 2 ne 227 with ever fewer exceptions what we see and read and hear have the mating act as a central theme censorship is forced offstage as a violation of individual freedom that which should be absolutely private is disrobed and acted out center stage in the shadows backstage are addiction pornography perversion infidelity abortion andthe saddest of them allincest and molestation in company with them now is a plague of biblical proportion and all of them are on the increase society excuses itself from responsibility except for teaching the physical process of reproduction to children in school to prevent pregnancy and disease and providing teenagers with devices which are supposed to protect them from both when any effort is made to include values in these courses basic universal values not just values of the church but of civilization of society itself the protest arises you are imposing religion upon us infringing upon our freedom freedom to choose while we pass laws to reduce pollution of the earth any proposal to protect the moral and spiritual environment is shouted down and marched against as infringing upon liberty agency freedom the right to choose interesting how one virtue when given exaggerated or fanatical emphasis can be used to batter down another with freedom a virtue invoked to protect vice those determined to transgress see any regulation of their lifestyle as interfering with their agency and seek to have their actions condoned by making them legal people who are otherwise sensible say i do not intend to indulge but i vote for freedom of choice for those who do flawed argument regardless of how lofty and moral the prochoice argument sounds it is badly flawed with that same logic one could argue that all traffic signs and barriers which keep the careless from danger should be pulled down on the theory that each individual must be free to choose how close to the edge he will go no free agency the phrase free agency does not appear in scripture the only agency spoken of there is moral agency which the lord said i have given unto him that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment dc 10178 italics added heeding the warning and the lord warned members of his church let not that which i have appointed be polluted by mine enemies by the consent of those who call themselves after my name for this is a very sore and grievous sin against me and against my people dc 1019798 italics added because the laws of man by and large do not raise moral issues we are taught to honor sustain and obey the law see a of f 112 and that he that keepeth the laws of god hath no need to break the laws of the land dc 5821 the right to speak out when a moral issue does arise it is the responsibility of the leaders of the church to speak out gambling for instance certainly is a moral issue life is a moral issue when morality is involved we have both the right and the obligation to raise a warning voice we do not as a church speak on political issues unless morality is involved in thirty years and thousands of interviews i have never once asked a member of the church what political party they belonged to physical and moral laws there are both moral and physical laws irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world dc 13020 which man cannot overrule for instance do you think a vote to repeal the law of gravity would do any good unenforceable suppose a law decreed that all children would be taken from their parents and raised by the state such a law would be wicked but probably could be enforced such things have been done before but suppose an article of that law stated within fifteen days the mother will cease all emotional ties to her child that provision is absolutely unenforceable no matter how severe the penalty or the number of enforcers it is absolutely unenforceable because it contravenes both natural and moral law no matter if fifteen weeks or months or fifteen years were allowed it cannot be enforced it may work with animals but all flesh the scriptures teach is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts 1 cor 1539 it cannot be made to work with human mothers never a manmade law against nature would be as impossible to defend as a law annulling love between mother and child would be impossible to enforce children of god no greater ideal has been revealed than the supernal truth that we are the children of god and we differ by virtue of our creation from all other living things see moses 6810 22 59 the evil idea no idea has been more destructive of happiness no philosophy has produced more sorrow more heartbreak and mischief no idea has done more to destroy the family than the idea that we are not the offspring of god only advanced animals compelled to yield to every carnal urge animals are not subject to moral law nevertheless while by and large they are promiscuous in responding to their mating instincts their mating rituals have set patterns and have rigid limitations for instance animals do not pair up with their own gender to satisfy their mating instincts nor are these instincts expressed in the molestation of their offspring the source of life is now relegated to the level of unwed pleasure bought and sold and even defiled in satanic rituals children of god can willfully surrender to their carnal nature and without remorse defy the laws of morality and degrade themselves even below the beasts most abominable if we pollute our fountains of life there will be penalties exquisite and hard to bear see dc 1915 more than all of the physical pleasure ever could be worth alma told his son corianton know ye not my son that these things are an abomination in the sight of the lord yea most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the holy ghost alma 395 the code for moral law is found in the scriptures stated as simply as wickedness never was happiness alma 4110 the scriptures speak in general terms leaving us free to apply the principles of the gospel to meet the infinite variety of life but when they say thou shalt not we had better pay attention the only legitimate employment of the power of procreation is between husband and wife man and woman who have been legally and lawfully married anything else violates the commandments of god from alma if ye speak against it it matters not for the word of god must be fulfilled alma 558 the measure of a successful parent it is a great challenge to raise a family in the darkening mists of our moral environment we emphasize that the greatest work you will do will be within the walls of your home see harold b lee ensign july 1973 p 98 and that no other success can compensate for failure in the home david o mckay improvement era june 1964 p 445 the measure of our success as parents however will not rest solely on how our children turn out that judgment would be just only if we could raise our families in a perfectly moral environment and that now is not possible it is not uncommon for responsible parents to lose one of their children for a time to influences over which they have no control they agonize over rebellious sons or daughters they are puzzled over why they are so helpless when they have tried so hard to do what they should it is my conviction that those wicked influences one day will be overruled the prophet joseph smith declaredand he never taught a more comforting doctrinethat the eternal sealings of faithful parents and the divine promises made to them for valiant service in the cause of truth would save not only themselves but likewise their posterity though some of the sheep may wander the eye of the shepherd is upon them and sooner or later they will feel the tentacles of divine providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to the fold either in this life or the life to come they will return they will have to pay their debt to justice they will suffer for their sins and may tread a thorny path but if it leads them at last like the penitent prodigal to a loving and forgiving fathers heart and home the painful experience will not have been in vain pray for your careless and disobedient children hold on to them with your faith hope on trust on till you see the salvation of god orson f whitney in conference report apr 1929 p 110 we cannot overemphasize the value of temple marriage the binding ties of the sealing ordinance and the standards of worthiness required of them when parents keep the covenants they have made at the altar of the temple their children will be forever bound to them president brigham young said let the father and mother who are members of this church and kingdom take a righteous course and strive with all their might never to do a wrong but to do good all their lives if they have one child or one hundred children if they conduct themselves towards them as they should binding them to the lord by their faith and prayers i care not where those children go they are bound up to their parents by an everlasting tie and no power of earth or hell can separate them from their parents in eternity they will return again to the fountain from whence they sprang joseph fielding smith doctrines of salvation comp bruce r mcconkie 3 vols 29091 repentance in the battle of life the adversary takes enormous numbers of prisoners and many who know of no way to escape and are pressed into his service every soul confined to a concentration camp of sin and guilt has a key to the gate the adversary cannot hold them if they know how to use it the key is labeled repentance the twin principles of repentance and forgiveness exceed in strength the awesome power of the adversary i know of no sins connected with the moral standard for which we cannot be forgiven i do not exempt abortion the formula is stated in forty words behold he who has repented of his sins the same is forgiven and i the lord remember them no more by this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sinsbehold he will confess them and forsake them dc 584243 i will remember your sins no more however long and painful the process of repentance the lord has said this is the covenant i will make with them i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more heb 101617 italics added civilizations like sodom and gomorrah destroyed themselves by disobedience to the laws of morality for the spirit of the lord will not always strive with man and when the spirit ceaseth to strive with man then cometh speedy destruction 2 ne 2611 see also gen 63 ether 215 dc 133 moses 817 god grant that we will come to our senses and protect our moral environment from this mist of darkness which deepens day by day the fate of all humanity hangs precariously in the balance and may we have the protection of him who is our father and our god and may we merit the love and blessings of his son our redeemer in whose name even the name of jesus christ i bear witness amen
