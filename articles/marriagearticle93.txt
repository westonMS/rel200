feeling the love of our heavenly father hearts must be pure with this phrase elder whitney teaches the importance of effective preparation to attend the temple we who would attend the temple must be living in a manner which helps us be worthy to enter and fully partake of the feast of which he spoke we examine our worthiness to enter the temple in our annual temple recommend interviews with priesthood leaders our signature with theirs on our temple recommend testifies of our worthiness to enter the temple how important it is to be completely honest with our bishop to be less than completely honest with him about our worthiness creates a breach of integrity which compounds the seriousness of concealed sins when we present our recommend to the attendant at the temple we reaffirm our worthiness to enter the temple if an unresolved problem exists since we received the recommend it would be well to obey our lords teaching expressed in his sermon on the mount therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift matt 52324 remember that the gifts we bring to his house are not the sacrifices our ancestors of old brought to their temples but the pure hearts of which brother whitney speaks we apply the lords direction by ensuring that our hearts are pure by examining our lives before we approach his house where there is an unresolved sin we should take the necessary penitent action to clear it we should also examine our relationships with our brother or sister or wife or husband or child or parent or anyone else who might have ought against us we should repair and strengthen any damaged relationship then come to the temple the truly humble and obedient take this preparation a step further they clear their hearts of any feelings which may be out of harmony with the sacred environment and sacred experiences they will encounter in the temple they will be mindful that feelings of anger hostility fear frustration haste or any preoccupation with matters outside the temple will interfere with their ability to fully partake of the feast available within the templewhich is a feast of the spirit those kinds of feelings are left outside the temple when we enter a temple is a place in which those whom he has chosen are endowed with power from on higha power which enables us to use our gifts and capabilities with greater intelligence and increased effectiveness in order to bring to pass our heavenly fathers purposes in our own lives and the lives of those we love as he dedicated the cornerstone of the salt lake temple on april 6 1853 president brigham young made this observation about the endowment your endowment is to receive all those ordinances in the house of the lord which are necessary for you after you have departed this life to enable you to walk back to the presence of the father passing the angels who stand as sentinels and gain your eternal exaltation in spite of earth and hell in journal of discourses 231 we receive the blessings of which president young spoke when we are endowed our understanding of the significance of the endowment expands as we regularly participate in the holy ordinances in behalf of those deceased some participate in the feast of which orson f whitney spoke more fully than others those who receive most understand the teaching methods the lord uses in the temple they bring to the temple hearts and minds prepared to participate in the lords way of learning others receive less and may be somewhat disappointed in their temple experience perhaps they do not understand how the lord teaches us in his house elder john a widtsoe said we live in a world of symbols no man or woman can come out of the temple endowed as he should be unless he has seen beyond the symbol the mighty realities for which the symbols stand temple worship utah genealogical and historical magazine apr 1921 p 62 if you may have been somewhat confused unclear or concerned about your temple experience i hope you will return again and again when you return come with an open seeking contrite heart and allow the spirit to teach you by revelation what the symbols can mean to you and the eternal realities which they represent elder widtsoe thoughtfully provided some counsel about how you might do this he spoke of the prophets first vision as a model of how revelation in the temple and elsewhere is received how do men receive revelations he asked how did the prophet joseph smith obtain his first revelation his first vision he desired something in a grove of trees away from human confusion he summoned all the strength of his nature there he fought the demon of evil and at length because of the strength of his desire and the great effort that he made the father and the son descended out of the heavens and spoke eternal truth to him ibid p 63 elder widtsoe observed that it was the strength of josephs desire and the great effort which enabled him to receive his vision of the father and the son desire and effort are likewise required if we would receive revelation to understand the ordinances of the endowment he wrote revelation is not imposed upon a person it must be drawn to us by faith seeking and working to the man or woman who goes through the temple with open eyes heeding the symbols and the covenants and making a steady continuous effort to understand the full meaning god speaks his word and revelations come the endowment which was given by revelation can best be understood by revelation and to those who seek most vigorously with pure hearts will the revelation be greatest ibid to understand the things of god requires a continuance effort a pure and receptive heart and an open mind revelation comes in response to our desire and seeking then we feast on the holy joys that tell of heaven president benson has given us a promise about this he said now by virtue of the sacred priesthood in me vested i promise you that with increased attendance in the temples of our god you shall receive increased personal revelation to bless your lives as you bless those who have died ensign may 1987 p 85 come to the temples worthily and regularly not only do you bless those who are deceased but you may freely partake of the promised personal revelation that may bless your life with power knowledge light beauty and truth from on high which will guide you and your posterity to eternal life what person would not want these blessings as expressed by the prophet joseph smith at the dedication of the kirtland temple he said we ask thee holy father that thy servants may go forth from this house armed with thy power and that thy name may be upon them and thy glory be round about them and thine angels have charge over them dc 10922 when you return from the temple share with your children and loved ones at home your feelings about what you experienced speak not of the sacred ordinances but of the love and power manifest by them let your children see you behavetoward them and your eternal companionin kindlier more loving ways your consistently positive expressions about what you experience in the temple will create in your children a desire to receive those same blessings and provide them with strong motivation to resist the temptations which could disqualify them from temple blessings through the exercise of the sealing power of the holy priesthood generations are bound together in patriarchal chains from the newborn baby as far back as the lord shall reveal brigham young in journal of discourses 3372 when sweethearts kneel at the temple altar and are joined by the power of the holy priesthood for time and all eternity an eternal family is organized and is created it is to exist throughout all eternity it may become eternal in its attributes by the constant fidelity of a husband and wife to one another and by their faithfulness to their covenants with their heavenly father may i invite those of you who are sealed to a spouse whether living or departed to recall for a moment your memories of that day of days when you knelt together at the altar and were sealed as husband and wife for time and all eternity do you remember any of the words of the ceremony do you recall sacred feelings a glimpse of eternal promises can you feel again the power that created a relationship which will transcend death can you recall the feeling of love of our heavenly father for you and your companion which was manifest on that occasion if time and the realities of everyday life have eroded your recollections of what you felt and received when you were sealed you should return to the temple and participate again as proxies for the departed in that same sealing ordinance take advantage of that opportunity do it together as husband and wife in this manner you may deepen your understanding of the covenants you made and renew the promises you received on that day when you were sealed as eternal companions for some of you these words may reopen wounds you wish closed and buried there may be a bitter tinge to the memories that those words invoke because that which once seemed so glorious and promising to you little resembles the reality you now experience your eternal marriage may have been destroyed by infidelity or apostasy or perhaps it is being eroded by indifference neglect or inattention to covenants you may have been a faithful spouse but are now involuntarily a lonely struggling single parent may your hearts be lifted by my testimony that your faithfulness to your endowment and sealing covenants assures you a fullness of the blessings promised the infidelity sin or indifference of a spouse need not adversely affect your faithfulness to your covenants i testify to you that the promised blessings are yours through your faithfulness to your covenants i testify that no matter how long and difficult the road you can with the support of loving leaders and the constant love of our savior arrive at your eternal destination now a word to those who may not now qualify for a temple recommend work with your priesthood leaders and change your life in order to worthily enter the temple then
