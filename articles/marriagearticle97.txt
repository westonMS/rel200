his sad story through sobs of sorrow anguish and remorse i wanted to cry with him pressured by his socalled friends he found himself at a mixed party where liquor was served against everything he knew to be right he succumbed to the taunts and jeers of all those present became drunk and before the evening was over lost his virtue unable to resist the peer pressure he faced his resolution to stay chaste being dissipated by the circumstances he found himself in he had seen his lifelong dream of a mission and a temple marriage change to a nightmareand now he felt ashamed uncleanunworthy have i forfeited my opportunity for a mission for marriage in the temple he asked how can my father in heaven forgive me for what i have done i wish the earth would open up and swallow me my heart ached for him almost overriding my sympathy for him was the anger i felt toward those who had led him down that primrose path seemingly oblivious to the pain they had caused listening to satans siren song that chastity is outdated thou shalt not commit adultery jehovah commanded and he that committeth adultery and repenteth not shall be cast out dc 4224 my beloved young brethren despite what the world would have us believe god has never changed that law the first presidency of the church in another time of moral crisis declared to the youth of the church we plead with you to live clean for the unclean life leads only to suffering misery and woe physicallyand spiritually it is the path to destruction how glorious and near to the angels is youth that is clean sexual purity is youths most precious

punishments and the judgments which the lord has declared against this sin the day of reckoning will come just as certainly as night follows day messages 6176 the full force of his actions was obvious to my tearful friend who understood at last the reality of almas words wickedness never was happiness alma 4110 as i shared those sad moments with that sorrowing young man i could not help contrasting his feelings with those of another whose sealing i had performed in the house of the lord there in the presence of their families the happy couple expressed their joy at the solemn covenants they had made with god and with each other as they knelt at that sacred altar looking into each others souls with complete trust and confidence approaching their marriage clean and worthy of the celestial blessings pronounced on their heads their happiness was unrestrained my beloved aaronic priesthood brethren with all you are learning as you progress toward virile manhood i pray that you will get understanding of the vital truth that chastity is the ultimate and perfect standard underlying all spiritual progression righteousness is happiness the lord has declared and no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood because of their faith and the repentance of all their sins and their faithfulness

before the lord firstbe patient dont be too anxious to grow up bask in the pleasure of anticipating what it will be like to be an adult remember you are only young once and you are going to be old for a long time our impatience often causes us to flirt with the forbidden forgetting the consequences of our foolish experimenting president harold b lee painted a vivid picture of the pain suffered through flirting then succumbing to temptation ive seen beautiful young human butterflies playing with the tempting fires of sin many of these beautiful human butterflies winged for heavenly flight have fallen with wings singed and badly seared because of their curiosity about the forbidden the more i see of life the more i am convinced that we must impress you young people with the awfulness of sin rather than to content ourselves with merely teaching the way of repentance i wish that someone could warn you of the night of hell that follows the committing of a moral sin as one who has sinned has described it in these words no one knew anything about it you told no one and no one found out no one condemned but your face flushed your heart beat against your ribs perspiration broke out upon your brow you went to bed that night you tied a bandage around the eyes of your soul you built a little shelter in which to hide you tried to sleep but no sleep came you said to yourself other people do it or i had to do it or no one else can ever find it out but there were hands from the unseen world that came through the darkness and tore the bandage from the eyes of the soul and smashed down the little shelter you had made for your cowering spirit youth and the church salt lake city deseret book co 1970 pp 8788 my young friends please be patient secondfocus on your eternal destiny the lord has promised the faithful all that my father hath shall be given unto him dc 8438 think what that means to you as a son of god brethren set limits to your actionsbounds you will not passfar from the line which separates good from evil be prepared for the experiences that lie ahead plan in advance how you will face temptationsweigh the consequences now and forever be sure you understand the situation confronting you if someone perhaps a friend asks you to do something you are not sure about restate what he has said you want me to do what next ask yourself will doing what my friend says break my rules or the law or hurt someone i respect or love or make someone distrust me then look at both sides of the question what good things will happen if you do this and what bad things will happen now that you have assessed all the results you are prepared to make a decision if everything is positive you will probably want to go along with your friend if not you have the responsibility to say no adapted from john w larsen youths frontier making ethical decisions irving texas boy scouts of america 1985 p 14 get tough with yourself president spencer w kimball gave us a powerful example in a talk to the youth of stockholm sweden describing his own boyhood he said as i was out alone milking the cows or putting up the hay i had time to think i mulled it over in my mind and made this decision i spencer kimball will never taste any form of liquor i spencer kimball will never touch tobacco i will never drink coffee nor will i ever touch teanot because i can explain why i shouldnt except that the lord said not to he said those things were an abomination there are many other things that are too that are not in the word of wisdom but i made up my mind thats the point i am trying to make i made up my mind then as a little boy i will never touch those things and so having made up my mind it was easy to follow it and i did not yield there were many temptations that came along but i did not even analyze it i did not stop and measure it and say well shall i or shall i not i always said to myself but i made up my mind i would not therefore i do not im a little older than any of you here tonight and i want to just say that i will soon go into another year and that i have never tasted tea nor coffee nor tobacco nor liquor of any kind nor drugs now that may sound very presumptuous and boasting to you but i am only trying to make this point that if every boy and girlas he or she begins to grow a little more mature and becomes a little more independent of his friends and his family and allif every boy and girl would make up his or her mind i will not yield then no matter what the temptation is i made up my mind thats settled in conference report
