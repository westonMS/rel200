pmyw0071 1988 may that be the clarion call for each of us as we serve in gods kingdom six months ago i spoke at this pulpit in general priesthood meeting to the single adult brethren of the church this evening i would like to speak for a few minutes to the single adult sisters of the church single adult sisters throughout the church i want you to know of my deep love and appreciation for youfor your goodness for your faithfulness for your desire to serve the lord with all your heart that christs true light through you will shine his name to glorify we see your example and service we see so many of you living christlike lives worthy of emulation and giving such dedicated service in the church we see you leading the music in primary and because of your love and care childrens eyes lighting up as they sing the sweet songs of zion we see you teaching by the spirit classes in relief society young women primary and sunday school with such excellent preparation and bearing testimony of gospel truths and touching others lives we see many of you effectively working with our teenage girls taking them to camp directing roadshows going to their dances and being a great example and a real friend to them we see you serving fulltime missions for the lord with devotion and dedication and returning from the mission field with an even greater capacity to serve we see you in singles wards and resident wards reaching out to the less active to the shy to the troubled reaching out to the widow the shutin and the lonely and inviting all of them to come unto christ we see wise bishops and stake presidents calling you single adult sisters to leadership responsibilities in wards and stakes we see you in the presidencies of relief society young women and primary organizations where your talents and abilities are being fully utilized we see you as a vital part of the mainstream body of the church we pray that the emphasis we naturally place on families will not make you feel less needed or less valuable to the lord or to his church the sacred bonds of church membership go far beyond marital status age or present circumstance your individual worth as a daughter of god transcends all now we also know you have special challenges and special needs be assured that we are aware of these keep the goal of celestial marriage i would like to express the hope we all have for you which is so real that you will be exalted in the highest degree of glory in the celestial kingdom and that you will enter into the new and everlasting covenant of marriage dear sisters never lose sight of this sacred goal prayerfully prepare for it and live for it be married the lords way temple marriage is a gospel ordinance of exaltation our father in heaven wants each of his daughters to have this eternal blessing therefore dont trifle away your happiness by involvement with someone who cannot take you worthily to the temple make a decision now that this is the place where you will marry to leave that decision until a romantic involvement develops is to take a risk the importance of which you cannot now fully calculate and remember you are not required to lower your standards in order to get a mate keep yourselves attractive maintain high standards maintain your selfrespect do not engage in intimacies that bring heartache and sorrow place yourselves in a position to meet worthy men and be engaged in constructive activities but also do not expect perfection in your choice of a mate do not be so concerned about his physical appearance and his bank account that you overlook his more important qualities of course he should be attractive to you and he should be able to financially provide for you but does he have a strong testimony does he live the principles of the gospel and magnify his priesthood is he active in his ward and stake does he love home and family and will he be a faithful husband and a good father these are qualities that really matter and i would also caution you single sisters not to become so independent and selfreliant that you decide marriage isnt worth it and you can do just as well on your own some of our sisters indicate that they do not want to consider marriage until after they have completed their degrees or pursued a career this is not right certainly we want our single sisters to maximize their individual potential to be well educated and to do well at their present employment you have much to contribute to society to your community and to your neighborhood but we earnestly pray that our single sisters will desire honorable marriage in the temple to a worthy man and rear a righteous family even though this may mean the sacrificing of degrees and careers our priorities are right when we realize there is no higher calling than to be an honorable wife and mother the lord knows and loves you i also recognize that not all women in the church will have an opportunity for marriage and motherhood in mortality but if those of you in this situation are worthy and endure faithfully you can be assured of all blessings from a kind and loving heavenly fatherand i emphasize all blessings i assure you that if you have to wait even until the next life to be blessed with a choice companion god will surely compensate you time is numbered only to man god has your eternal perspective in mind i also recognize that some of our sisters are widowed or divorced my heart is drawn to you who are in these circumstances the brethren pray for you and we feel a great obligation to see that your needs are met trust in the lord be assured he loves you and we love you if you are a single parent make friends with others in similar situations and develop friendships with married couples counsel with your priesthood leaders let them know of your needs and wants single parenthood is understood by the lord he knows the special challenges that are yours you are his daughters he loves you and will bless and sustain you this i know learn progress serve now to all the single adult sisters regardless of your present situation be faithful keep the commandments establish a deep and abiding relationship with the lord jesus
