defense of your godgiven freedom and liberty remember that your entire life is a mission and that each new phase of it can be richly rewarding as you magnify your talents and take advantage of your opportunities may i now say an additional word about an eternal opportunity and responsibility to which i have referred earlier and which is of greatest importance to you i am referring to celestial marriage just a few weeks ago i received a letter from two devoted parents part of which reads as follows dear president benson we are concerned about what seems to be a growing problemat least in this part of the church familiar to usthat is so many choice young men in the church over the age of thirty who are still unmarried we have sons thirty thirtyone and thirtythree in this situation many of our friends also are experiencing this same concern for unmarried sons and daughters their letter continues in our experience these are usually young men who have been on missions are well educated and are living the commandments except this most important one there does not appear to be a lack of choice young ladies in the same age bracket who could make suitable companions it is most frustrating to us as their parents who sometimes feel we have failed in our parental teachings and guiding responsibilities my dear single adult brethren we are also concerned we want you to know that the position of the church has never changed regarding the importance of celestial marriage it is a commandment of god the lords declaration in genesis is still true and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone gen 218 to obtain a fulness of glory and exaltation in the celestial kingdom one must enter into this holiest of ordinances without marriage the purposes of the lord would be frustrated choice spirits would be withheld from the experience of mortality and postponing marriage unduly often means limiting your posterity and the time will come brethren when you will feel and know that loss i can assure you that the greatest responsibility and the greatest joys in life are centered in the family honorable marriage and rearing a righteous posterity and the older you become the less likely you are to marry and then you may lose these eternal blessings altogether president spencer w kimball recounted an experience he once had recently i met a young returned missionary who is 35 years old he had been home from his mission for 14 years and yet he was little concerned about his bachelorhood and laughed about it i shall feel sorry for this young man when the day comes that he faces the great judge at the throne and when the lord asks this boy where is your wife all of his excuses which he gave to his fellows on earth will seem very light and senseless when he answers the judge i was very busy or i felt i should get my education first or i did not find the right girlsuch answers will be hollow and of little avail he knew he was commanded to find a wife and marry her and make her happy he knew it was his duty to become the father of children and provide a rich full life for them as they grew up he knew all this yet postponed his responsibility ensign feb 1975 p 2 i realize that some of you brethren may have genuine fears regarding the real responsibilities that will be yours if you do marry you are concerned about being able to support a wife and family and provide them with the necessities in these uncertain economic times those fears must be replaced with faith i assure you brethren that if you will be industrious faithfully pay your tithes and offerings and conscientiously keep the commandments the lord will sustain you yes there will be sacrifices required but you will grow from these and will be a better man for having met them work hard educationally and in your vocation put your trust in the lord have faith and it will work out the lord never gives a commandment without providing the means to accomplish it see 1 ne 37 also do not be caught up in materialism one of the real plagues of our generationthat is acquiring things fastpaced living and securing career success in the single state honorable marriage is more important than wealth position and status as husband and wife you can achieve your lifes goals together as you sacrifice for each other and your children the lord will bless you and your commitment to the lord and your service in his kingdom will be enhanced now brethren do not expect perfection in your choice of a mate do not be so particular that you overlook her most important qualities of having a strong testimony living the principles of the gospel loving home wanting to be a mother in zion and supporting you in your priesthood responsibilities of course she should be attractive to you but do not just date one girl after another for the sole pleasure of dating without seeking the lords confirmation in your choice of your eternal companion and one good yardstick as to whether a person might be the right one for you is this in her presence do you think your noblest thoughts do you aspire to your finest deeds do you wish you were better than you are god bless you single adult brethren of the church may your priorities be right i have suggested some very important priorities this evening may you seriously consider and ponder them know my good brethren that i have spoken from my heart and by his spirit because of my love and concern for you it is what the lord would have you hear today with all my heart i echo the words of the prophet lehi from the book of mormon arise from the dust my sons and be men 2 ne 121 in the name of jesus christ amen
