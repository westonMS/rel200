Abstract: 
Objective: The purpose of our study is to show how the relationship between marital adjustment and satisfaction will change in cases of chronic disease in either or both spouses of married couples using a multivariate statistical analysis method.

Methods: Marriage adjustment ve marriage satisfaction scales were used. A structural equation modeling - multiple group analysis method was used in the study, which was designed as a relational screening model.

Results: In the study, which included 898 participants, 56.6% of the participants were female and 43.4% were male. The mean age of the participants was 36.94 [+ or -] 8.72 standard deviations. First, the relationship between marital adjustment and satisfaction was analyzed using structural equation modeling, and the relationship between the scales was found to be statistically significant (p=0.001). In the model, which was significant and sufficient, the variable of chronic disease was coded on the arrow representing the regression coefficient between the scales, and multiple group analysis was applied. The relationship between marital adjustment and satisfaction was found to be weak among individuals with chronic diseases. The rate of marriage satisfaction explaining marriage adjustment was lower in individuals without chronic disease ([R.sup.2]=0.16) than in those without chronic disease ([R.sup.2]=0.10). While ego scores were not significant in individuals without chronic disease (p=0.237), they were statistically significant in individuals with chronic disease (p=0.017).

Conclusion: Chronic diseases has been found to have a significant impact on the relationship between spouses. Many studies have examined the effects of chronic diseases on marriage. However, our study differs from other studies because of the analytical methods used. In the scales, it was determined whether the chronic disease showed a change in the relationship between the scales, not the scores in the chronic disease state.

Keywords: SEM, multiple group analysis, chronic diseases, marriage satisfaction, marriage adjustment

INTRODUCTION

Chronic diseases is necessary to be under control to ensure that individuals can fulfill their duties and responsibilities in personal care without forcing them and to control the progression of the disease [1]. According to a WHO report in 2011, 85% of the deaths in our country in 2008 were due to chronic diseases [2]. Several studies have revealed that chronic diseases have different psychosocial effects on individuals. In the studies carried out, individuals with chronic diseases, such as fear, hopelessness, depression, helplessness, fear of death, and introversion. It is known that these situations are experienced very frequently, and as a result, the quality of life of individuals is negatively affected [1,3].

Problems or diseaseses experienced by family members also cause adverse effects on other family members. Families support each other throughout their lives. In adverse situations, the assumeer roles in the family will change, and the people who take on the role of caregiver from the members of the family will change. Family oriented approaches play an important role in the definition and progression of diseases. Studies have shown that family oriented care positively contributes to both the functioning of health systems and diagnosis and treatment of the disease process [4]. It has been stated that marriages are negatively affected by chronic diseases and physical or mental disorders in any of the spouses, and marital adjustment will be damaged [5].

Marriage which is the smallest structural unit of society, is defined as an institution that consists of spouses forming a partnership by sharing responsibilities and a contract on the bond between the spouses [6].

Marital adjustment and satisfaction appear to be concepts used interchangeably. Marital satisfaction: This is the evaluation of the mutual benefits and harms as a whole that spouses have good psychology during the continuation of marriage [7-8]. Marital adjustment: This is defined as the ability of spouses to solve problems together and live with strong communication [9]. As a result of the physical and mental reflection of harmony in marriages to individuals, their quality of life increases, positive effects are observed in their general health status, and life satisfaction increases [10-11]. Quality marriage has positive effects on the happiness of individuals. The most important determinant of happy and healthy marriages is ensuring marital satisfaction. Marriage satisfaction will also increase in individuals who provide marital satisfaction, their quality of life and their support for each other will increase [12].

A significant number of studies in the literature have examined roles of marriage's satisfacion and adjustment. The main issue covered in this study is how the relationship between marital adjustment and satisfaction changes in the case of chronic diseases. Considering that considering the issues chronic diseases has a moderator effect on marital satisfaction and adjustment, a multi-group analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied. The most important feature of the analysis is that the presence of chronic disease was entered into the expressions representing the basic relationships between the variables (arrows showing the regression coefficients), and the disease was included as a moderator variable in the regression model. SEM is a multivariate analysis method that allows the examination of complex data, examines the indirect and direct effects between observable and unobservable variables, uses multiple regression equations simultaneously, presents the models established between the data visually, includes error terms in the model, and explains the covariance structures between the variables [13-15].

MATERIAL AND METHODS Type of Research and Hypotheses

A relational screening model was used to design this study. The preferred model for examining the multifaceted relationships between variable sets provides an opportunity to examine indirect and direct effects [16].

The working hypotheses are as follows:

* [H.sub.1]: The effect of marital adjustment on marital satisfaction is statistically significant.

* [H.sub.2]: The moderating effect of chronic disease on marital adjustment and satisfaction is statistically significant.

Place and Time of Research

Data were collected face-to-face and via Google Forms from individuals married for at least three years between January and May 2023. At the stage of obtaining data, the forms were limited to receiving only one answer from each participant. The cookies and IP addresses were checked to determine the reliability of the data.


Sample Selection and Number of Samples

Although there is no clearly defined term for SEM, Schumacher and Lomax (2004) stated that there are studies using 250-500 sample sizes [14]. On the other hand, in the SEM analyses, Kline required a sample number of 200 or more [16]. Accordingly, 918 data forms were collected for this study. However, 23 questionnaires were excluded from the study because they did not provide consent. This study included 895 married participants. Participants were selected by voluntary sampling and snowball sampling, which are non-probability sampling methods.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Being between the ages of 25-50, being married for at least three years, being literate, and completing the questionnaire completely were the inclusion criteria of the study. Partners with chronic diseases that did not require any additional care assistance (diabetes, blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, rheumatic diseases, asthma, etc.) were included in the study.

Data Collection Tools

Personal Information Form

The form consisting of gender, age, educational status, occupation, socioeconomic status, and chronic disease variables, which will help define personal characteristics, was applied to the participants.

Marriage Satisfaction Scale (MSS)

The scale developed in 2009 consists of 13 items and three sub-dimensions. The internal consistency coefficient of the scale, whose sub-dimensions were family, sexuality, and self, was calculated as Cronbach's a 0.790. As the score obtained from the scale increases, individuals' marital satisfaction also increases [17].

Marriage Adjustment Scale (MAS)

The scale, first developed by Locke and Walles in 1959 [18]. was adapted into Turkish by Tutarel Kislak in 1999. The scale consists of 15 questions and has a single sub-dimension. The low number of items in the scale is one of the most important reasons for its extensive use. The increase in the scores on the scale, which is scored between 0-60, is expressed as an increase in the harmony of the spouses' feelings, economy, friendship, life criteria, and social characteristics. It has been stated that spouses with high scores have high trust in each other [19].

Statistical Analysis

AMOS 24 and SPSS (Statistical Program in Social Sciences) 28.0 programs were used for the analysis. The significance level (p) value was set at 0.05, and the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, number, and percentage values were used as descriptive statistics. Using the AMOS program, Mardia's coefficient was found to be 1.827 [16]. The calculated value was less than eight showed that the data were suitable for multivariate analysis [20]. Multivariate analysis assumptions, homogeneity of variance, multicollinearity, autocorrelation, etc., were checked, and the reliability coefficient was calculated using Cronbach's a. In the first established path diagram, the measurement model in which the MSS score was the independent variable and the MAS score was the dependent variable. Chronic diseases were included in the model as the moderator variable, depending on the significance of the model. A path diagram was established, in which the MSS score was the independent variable and the MAS score was the dependent variable, and SEM analysis was applied. Structural equation Modeling, which is frequently preferred in the analysis of relational screening models, was used in this study [16].

RESULTS

Demographic information of participants are given in Table 1. In study 508 (56.6 %) were female and 390 (43.4%) were male. The age range of the individuals was 25-50 and the mean was calculated as 36.94 [+ or -] 8.72 standard deviations and 159 (17.7 %) were primary school graduates, 294 (32.7%) were high school graduates, and 445 (49.6%) were undergraduate or higher graduates (Table 1).

The descriptive statistics of the scores of the individuals included in the study from the scales and subdimensions used in the study are given in Table 2. The MAS Cronbach's a coefficient was 0.817, and the MSS Cronbach's a coefficient was 0.895 (Table 2).

Multiple Group Analysis - SEM

In the first path diagram, the effect of marital adjustment on marital satisfaction was examined. In the model, marital adjustment scale scores represent the independent variable, marital satisfaction scale scores represent the dependent variable, and el-e4 are residual terms. Scale sub-dimension scores that do not have the effect of confounding factors on the scale total score, which is a latent variable in structural equation modeling analyzes, are modeled as observed variables and have a direct effect on the scores. The path diagram of the measurement model is shown in Figure 1.


The regression coefficients and significance of the established models are presented in Table 2.

In the model; Goodness-of-fit index values obtained as a result of the analysis [chi square] (CMIN) 7.794, degrees of freedom (sd) 2, [chi square]/sd 3.897, GFI (Godness of Fit Index, Goodness of Fit Index) 0.996, CFI (Compretive Fit Index, Comparative Fit Index) 0.933, IFI (Incremental Fit Index of Error 0.93), RMSEA (Root Mean Square Root of Approximate Errors) was found to be 0.057 (Table 5).

In the model, 13% ([R.sup.2]= 0.13) of the MSS score was explained by MAS score. MAS scores had a statistically significant effect on MSS scores ([[beta].sub.1]=0.360, p=0.001<0.05, Table 3), and MSS scores also increased depending on the increase in MAS score. In addition, the effects of the MSS sub-dimensions of Family Sexuality and Ego scores were statistically significant (p<0.05, Table 3).

The established measurement model is statistically sufficient, and the number of samples taken represents the model (Table 5). Since the effects on the measurement model were statistically significant, it was included in the model as a variable with a chronic disease-modulating effect. In the newly established model, the presence or absence of chronic diseases was coded into the path coefficient between the variables, and a multiple group analysis was applied.

Using multigroup analysis, categorical variables consisting of two or more groups that had a moderator effect were included in the model. The main purpose of this study was to determine the role of categorical variables in the relationship between the observed variables. The Critical Z value was interpreted in evaluating the statistical significance of the difference between the groups of the determined categorical variable. The fact that the "Critical Z value," which tests the differentiation in the path coefficients in the groups of the categorical variable, is higher than 1.96, shows a statistical difference for the groups [21]. The path diagram of the established multigroup analysis model is shown in Figure 2.

A In the newly established model, the goodness of fit index values obtained as a result of the analysis were calculated as [chi square] 10,505, sd 2, and [chi square]/sd 2.626. The RMSEA value, which is the index showing the adequacy of the sample number, is 0.043, indicating that the sample size is at a very good level for the model used. GFI value of 0.994, CFI value of 0.929, and IFI value of 0.934 were found to be very good in terms of the fit indices of the model (Table 5). The interpretations of the regression coefficients in the path diagram and the "Critical Z value" of the chronic variable are presented in Table 4.

In participants without chronic diseases, 16% ([R.sup.2]= 0.16) of the MSS score in the model was explained by the MAS score. MAS scores had a statistically significant effect on MSS scores ([[beta].sub.1]=0.40, p=0.001<0.05, Table 4), and MSS scores increased depending on the increase in MAS score. In addition, the effect of the MSS sub-dimensions of Family (p=0.001<0.05, Table 4) and Sexuality (p=0.006<0.05, Table 4) scores was statistically significant, but the effect of ego scores was not statistically significant (p=0.237>0.05, Table 4).

In individuals with chronic diseases, 10% ([R.sup.2]=0.10) of the MSS score in the model was explained by the MAS score. MAS scores had a statistically significant effect on MSS scores ([[beta].sub.1]=0.31, p=0.001<0.05, Table 4), and MSS scores also increased with increasing MAS scores. In addition, the effects of the MSS sub-dimensions of Family (p=0.001<0.05, Table 4), Sexuality (p=0.044<0.05, Table 4) and Ego scores were statistically significant (p=0.017<0.05, Table 4).

DISSCUSION

The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient of the "Marriage Adjustment" and "Marriage Satisfaction" scales are at the desired level [22]. While 427 (47.6%) participants were individuals without chronic disease, 471 (52.4%) were individuals with chronic disease.

A path diagram was established between MAS and MSS, and a measurement model analysis was performed. In the first path diagram established, there was a statistically significant positive relationship between MAS and MSS, and as a result of 1 point increase in MSS scores, MAS scores increased by 0.129 points ([[beta].sub.2] =0.129, p=0.001<0.05, Table 3). The measurement model was statistically significant and sufficient, and the fit index values were found at the desired level [20]. Because of the significance of the measurement model, the categorical variable, whether there is a chronic disease, was included in the model. Since the chronic disease included in the model is a variable that has a moderating effect on the relationship between MAS and MSS, the path coefficient was coded according to the presence or absence of disease in the established path diagram, and two different models were obtained. The role, significance, and effect of chronic diseases on the relationship between the scales, and not the scales, were analyzed statistically. Chronic diseases tend to occur, especially in mid-late adulthood and during marriage [23]. Studies on the effect of diseases on marital relationships have shown that the presence of physical diseases in one of the spouses has negative effects on marital adjustment and family functionality [24]. However, this relationship was bidirectional. In other words, marital adjustment can also trigger chronic diseases. It is known that similar lifestyles in couples can be effective in treating chronic diseases [25].

Recently, it has been suggested that marriage is not only related to physical and mental health but also to the relationship between the quality of marriage and health status [26-27]. Studies have shown that high marital satisfaction positively affects couples' physical and mental health. In marriages where marital satisfaction is low, the physical health of individuals may be negatively affected [28-29].

In MSS scores, family (p=0.001<0.05, Table 4), sexuality (p=0.044<0.05, Table 4), and ego (p=0.017<0.05, Table 4) sub-dimensions were statistically significant in those with chronic disease (p<0.05; Table 4), but in those without chronic disease, family (p=0.001<0.05, Table 4) and sexuality (p=0.006<0.05, Table 4) sub-dimensions had a statistically significant effect (p<0.05; Table 4), whereas ego sub-dimensions did not have a statistically significant effect (p=0.237>0.05; Table 4). Based on these data, it was concluded that self-esteem may be effective in the relationship between marital satisfaction and marital adjustment in the presence of chronic diseases. Self-esteem is a variable associated with marital satisfaction. According to Rosenberg (1979) self-esteem determines an individual's attitude towards himself. Individuals with high self-esteem respected themselves positively. Many factors, such as the long and difficult treatment process of chronic diseases and changes in body image, disrupt the adaptation of individuals [30-31]. This situation can affect self-esteem. Marital satisfaction and harmony of individuals whose self-esteem is affected by chronic diseases may also deteriorate.

In a study conducted with 297 women with heart disease in 2021, it was observed that the support of women from their husbands positively affected their marriage [32]. A study conducted in 2000 showed that marriage had a positive effect on chronic diseases [33]. Waltz et al. Data from 400 men with heart disease and their spouses were collected for five years, and the role of the long-term cognitive effects of diseases in marriage was examined. While supportive marriage environments have positive effects on the health of men in marriages with healthy relationships, negative effects have been found in marriages where adequate social support is not provided between spouses [34].

When the effects of diseases on marriage were examined, it was found that emotional and physical disorders could cause problems in relationships. A health problem in any of the spouses will negatively affect the quality of marriage, and the perception of happiness will decrease among the spouses [5]. In a study conducted in 2014 with the wives of healthy men with Parkinson's, it was observed that the risk of death was higher in women with Parkinson's. The death risk finding, which is one of the most concrete indicators of chronic diseases in marriage, was revealed in the study [35]. In a study conducted by August et al. [36] in 2010, sex and marital status were found to be effective in the management of chronic diseases. In a study conducted using data obtained from 3055 people and their spouses in Korea, Min et al. found that the quality of the relationship and the care of the spouse are effective in alleviating the depression that may be caused by the chronic disease, and the health status of the spouses is related to each other [37].

In our study, the model in which chronic disease has a moderating effect on the relationship between MAS and the MSS was found to be statistically significant and sufficient. The goodness-of-fit indices are at the desired level [20]. A statistically significant difference was found in MAS scores explaining MSS scores between those with and without chronic disease (Critical Z Value=2.013>1.96). The effect of MAS scores on MSS scores was found to be higher in the absence of chronic disease ([[beta].sub.1]=0.40, p=0.001<0.05, Table 4) than in the presence of chronic disease ([[beta].sub.1]=0.31, p=0.001<0.05, Table 4).

In a statement published by the American Academy of Health Behavior Work Group on Doctoral Research Training in 2005, it was stated that multivariate statistical analysis methods (regression models, generalized linear models, etc.) should be preferred instead of univariate statistical analysis methods (t test, Mann Whitney U test, ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis, etc.) Problems such as data loss and difficulty in interpretation as a result of univariate analyses can be solved by multivariate statistical analysis methods, analyzed and interpreted in unobservable relationships, and researchers will obtain more information about their work [37-38]. In line with this opinion, SEM, a multivariate statistical analysis method, was preferred in our study. The multiple Gorups analysis method we used was a moderator effect analysis method [21]. SEM shows that the direct and indirect relationships between the variables provide different results for researchers to interpret. In the analysis of error terms, calculations are made by keeping the differences between the sample and estimated covariance matrices at a minimum level, unlike ANOVA and multivariate regression models [14-39]. The model established for the analysis applied in our study and the error terms, relationships between unobservable variables, and change in categorical data in the relationship between the two scales are shown both graphically and mathematically.


Limitations

The limitations of our study; the use of online methods in the data collection system, the unwillingness of married couples to answer some questions, the selected married couples to have been married for at least three years.

CONCLUSION

Our study is the first to include chronic disease as a moderator variable in the relationship between MAS and MSS and to test it using multiple group analysis. For this reason, it will serve as a guide for other studies in this field. The results obtained from the established relationships may differ depending on the sample numbers and structures used in the studies. The reluctance of married couples to answer these questions increased the limitations of the study. As the results of our study may differ between cultures, it will shed light on other studies to be carried out and contribute to the literature.

Main Points;

* Chronic diseases may have negative effects on marital satisfaction and adjustment.

* Marriage satisfaction and adjustment of individuals whose self-esteem is affected by chronic diseases may also deteriorate.

* Using multiple group analyses as an alternative to parametric univariate analyses minimized losses in data interpretation.

                              The low estimated value suggests that the
                              covariance
                              structures are similar. In determining the

CMIN / df                     the number of samples is effective. The %2
                              value
                              decreases as the number of samples

                              the independence model compares the

                              It is obtained by computing the NFI value
                              with
IFI (Incremental Fit Index)   df. It eliminates the sample's influence

                              It is a substitute for the value
                              [chi square]. It is calculated
                              independently of sample count. It is also
                              known
GFI (Goodness of Fit Index)   as the model's sample variance explained.
                              It is
                              comparable to the [R.sup.2] value obtained
                              in multivariate
