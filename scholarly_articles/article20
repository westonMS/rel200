Marriage, Children and Subjective Well-being
INTRODUCTION
Subjective well-being (from hereon, referred to as SWB) is an area of research that has
the been subject of a great many empirical studies, the large majority of which have at
least made some attempt to control for variations across individuals in familial
characteristics. As observed by Diener et al. (1999) in their review of this literature,
analyses of cross-section data have consistently found that married persons report being
happier and more satisfied with their lives than unmarried persons. Such findings are
consistent with the widely held view that marriage, by providing emotional and financial
support, can directly enhance personal well-being.
While, a priori, the effects of children are less certain, the omission of controls for
parental status from analyses of inter-personal differences in happiness or life satisfaction
would be no less noticeable. To the extent that they confer utility on parents, we would
expect children to enhance personal well-being. On the other hand, children are costly
and are often the source of considerable anxiety and stress, which can be expected to
reduce life satisfaction. Very differently, it might be that most people either achieve the
family size desired or come to be contented with the size achieved, and hence the
presence of children would have no impact on SWB (Evans and Kelley 2002). In a
review of the earlier research Diener (1984) concluded that most studies report that the
presence of children either has a negative effect or no effect on SWB. More recent
research is consistent with this observation, with some studies finding that a negative
effect dominates (e.g., Clark and Oswald 1994, Marks and Fleming 1999, Clark,
Georgellis and Sanfey 2001, Frijters, Haisken-DeNew and Shields 2002, Di Tella,
MacCulloch and Oswald 2003), while others have reported insignificant relationships
(e.g., Mastekaasa 1994a, Stack and Eshleman 1998, Evans and Kelley 2002).
There is thus a clear consensus among researchers about the need to control for both
marital and parental status when analyzing measures of SWB. Despite this, however,
many studies of SWB have continued to treat family characteristics as little more than
influences that once controlled for, can be safely ignored. Even among those studies that
have focused specifically on the influence of the family, the emphasis has tended to be on
one specific aspect.
In this study we examine a number of related issues that have either tended to be
neglected in previous research or have been considered in isolation of each other. First,
we explicitly distinguish marital unions according to whether or not that union is the
subject of a registered marriage. Second, we test whether there is a “honeymoon effect”
associated with marriage by examining whether well-being changes with the length of a
marriage. Third, we test whether the lower levels of well-being typically reported
following separation and divorce dissipate with time. Fourth, among those in formal
marriages we distinguish between first, second, and subsequent marriages, while among
those cohabiting we distinguish between the never married and those who have been
previously married. Fifth, in isolating the possible impacts of children on SWB, we
distinguish children according to their age. Moreover, we move beyond the focus on
3
dependent children to consider whether the presence of adult children can impact on
SWB. Sixth, we interact both the number of dependent children and the number of adult
children with marital status.
A final feature of this analysis of note is the data source – a large nationally
representative sample of Australian households and their members. As previously
observed by Stack and Eshleman (1998), existing evidence on the relationships between
family structure and SWB has tended to be dominated by US data, and hence analyses
employing data from other countries are needed to determine whether existing findings
are culture specific. Additionally, the data set is extremely rich in its content, allowing
inclusion of an extensive set of controls for other variables typically presumed to
influence SWB.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Marriage vs Cohabitation: Is There a Difference?
It has been well established that married individuals are happier and more emotionally
stable than their unmarried counterparts (see Diener 1984, Coombs 1991 and Diener et al.
1999 for reviews of this literature). One of the major reasons advanced to explain this
finding is social isolation – unmarried persons are less happy because they are more
likely to be living alone and absent the continuing companionship that we typically
associate with marriage. However, if this is so, it follows that it is not the institution of
marriage that is important for well-being, but living with other people, and in particular
with a partner who can provide emotional and physical support. Alternatively, if it is
commitment that makes formal marriage so rewarding, as is often argued (e.g.,
Mastekaasa 1993, Waite and Gallagher 2000) and given a formal marriage implies a
greater level of commitment thus enhancing the expectation of a long-term stable
relationship (as argued by Evans and Kelley 2002), then we might expect the levels of
SWB reported by unmarried couples to be lower than that reported by married couples.
Somewhat surprisingly, given the marked rise in most Western countries in the numbers
of persons choosing to live together as couples without marrying, these hypotheses have
received relatively little attention from researchers. Most researchers instead have, at
least implicitly, chosen to treat persons cohabiting in unmarried (or de facto)
relationships as if they were either married or single (and in many cases it is unclear
which assumption has been adopted). Notable exceptions here are Kurdek (1991),
Mastekaasa (1994b), Stack and Eshleman (1998), Marks and Fleming (1999) and Evans
and Kelley (2002). Kurdek (1991), using data from a nationally representative sample of
US citizens, found that unmarried persons who cohabited reported happiness levels that
were significantly higher than single persons but lower than those reported by married
persons. Broadly similar results were obtained by Stack and Eshleman (1998) in their
study using data from samples of individuals drawn from 17 different countries, and by
Marks and Fleming in their Australian samples. Such findings are thus consistent with
both the social isolation and commitment hypotheses. In contrast, Mastekaasa (1994b),
using data from Norway, found that cohabitants reported levels of life satisfaction that
were not significantly different from married persons, a result that possibly reflects the
greater acceptance of cohabitation in Scandinavian countries. Evans and Kelley (2002),
on the other hand, in their recent analysis of life satisfaction data collected from a large
4
sample of Australian citizens, could find no evidence that unmarried couples were
happier than single persons. Indeed, for women they found that de facto relationships
were associated with significantly lower levels of life satisfaction relative to the levels
reported by women who had never married.
One weakness of all of these studies is that the data employed are now quite dated and
dominated by observations from the 1980s. The data used by Kurdek (1991), Mastekaasa
(1994b) and by Stack and Eshleman (1998) were collected over the periods 1987 to 1988,
1984 to 1986 and 1981 to 1983, respectively. Somewhat differently, Marks and Fleming
(1999) used pooled panel data collected from four separate youth cohorts over the period
1980 to 1995. Only for the oldest two cohorts, however, were individuals followed for
very long (i.e., beyond the age of 24 years), and in both of these cases the majority of
data points were from the 1980s. Finally, the data used by Evans and Kelley (2002)
comprised pooled cross-section observations collected in a number of waves over the
period 1984 to 2001. Nevertheless, the earlier waves were by far the largest and hence the
majority of their sample came from the period 1984 to 1989.
This predominance of 1980s data is of large importance when considering the
experiences of citizens of Anglo-Saxon societies, such as the USA and Australia. In both
these cases the treatment of de facto couples by judicial and government institutions has
clearly been changing over time. Indeed, at the start of the 21st century, persons living in
de facto relationships can, in Australia at least, expect the same legal rights as married
persons. As a result, it is now relatively uncommon for individuals to enter formal
marriage without a period of preceding cohabitation – 72 per cent of those who married
in Australia in 2001 cohabited prior to marriage (ABS 2002). We thus expect that, in
more recent data, differences in the levels of SWB between persons living as couples in
legal marriages and those living together without being married are likely to be very
small.
Does SWB Decline with Marriage Duration?
A widely held belief is that marital satisfaction is highest during the initial years of
marriage – the honeymoon effect – and then gradually declines with duration of marriage.
Moreover, such views receive empirical support from panel studies on marital success
and failure (e.g., Glenn 1998, VanLaningham, Johnson and Amato 2001). Cross-section
analysis, however, is complicated by selection effects. That is, unhappy marriages are
more likely to end in separation (and divorce) and hence the longest marriages are also
likely to be the happiest. This suggests that any inverse relationship between marriage
duration and SWB will be under-estimated, especially at the upper end of the distribution.
Indeed, we might expect the relationship between duration of marriage and SWB to be
best captured by a quadratic specification, with a U-shaped relationship expected (as is
often found in research on marital satisfaction). That is, SWB is likely to be greatest for
persons in both new marriages and long-running marriages.
Does SWB Recover Following Separation and Divorce?
Another well established finding is that among single people, it is the divorced that
express the lowest levels of SWB (see Amato 2000 for a recent review). Most researchers
explain this in terms of stress. The process of separation and divorce is typically stressful,
even if anticipated, and invariably involves major changes in a person’s life. Thus even if
5
separation is perceived is desirable, it is still likely to induce considerable stress. Where
researchers are in less agreement is over the question of whether such effects are
permanent or transitory. As summarized by Amato (2000, p. 1273), in one perspective –
the crisis model – separation and divorce are stressful experiences that individuals
gradually adjust to and eventually return to their pre-separation level of functioning. In
contrast, in the chronic strain model, separation and divorce is associated with strains and
hardships that are more permanent, such as loneliness and increased financial stress.
Are Persons in Second Marriages Any Less Happy than Persons in First Marriages?
Of course, one obvious solution to both loneliness and financial pressures is remarriage,
but are second (and subsequent) marriages associated with the same (or higher) levels of
SWB experienced during the first marriage? Empirical research on this issue is both
relatively limited and mixed in terms of findings. Studies that have focused on
differences in marital happiness across marriages (as distinct from global measures of
SWB) have typically not found significant differences between first and second
marriages (e.g., Johnson and Booth 1998, Rogers 1999), a result which is consistent with
Evans and Kelley (2002), who found in their Australian cross-section that persons who
have re-married are no less satisfied with their lives than persons in their first marriage.
Longitudinal studies of marriage transitions, however, are less positive. Spanier and
Furstenberg (1982), for example, could find little evidence that remarriage enhanced the
well-being of previously divorced persons, though arguably their sample was too small to
reveal significant associations. More positive results were reported by Marks and
Lambert (1998) using a much larger nationally representative sample, though again
statistical significance was generally not achieved.
Do Children Raise or Lower SWB?
As noted earlier, there is considerable evidence to suggest that persons with dependent
children have lower levels of SWB than those without dependents, findings that have
been interpreted by some (e.g., McLanahan and Adams 1987) as symptomatic of the
decline in the economic benefits of children and one of the factors contributing to the
decline in fertility levels in most Western nations. A more complete assessment of the
perceived benefits of children, however, requires adopting a lifetime perspective. Marks
and Fleming (1999), for example, argue that the relationship between children and SWB
is likely to be age (and gender) specific. Most obviously, younger children will be both
more demanding on the time of parents than older children and impose greater costs
(especially childcare costs). This suggests the need for interacting measures of the
presence of children with their age. Like most researchers, however, Marks and Fleming
are only concerned with children living at home. They thus ignore the potential benefits
that children might provide to their parents after leaving home. Research on SWB needs
to take into account not just the impact of children when young, but their impact as they
mature. Nevertheless, while there are a number of studies of the impact of childlessness
on the SWB of older adults (e.g., Koropeckyj-Cox 1998, 2002, Zhang and Hayward
2001), we are unaware of any study that has attempted to examine how the impact of
children of different ages, and including adult children, impacts on SWB within a more
general population sample.
6
Do the Effects of Children on Parental Well-being Vary with Marital Status?
Studies of SWB have generally assumed that any effects from children will impact on all
parents equally. There are, however, good reasons to expect that children will interact
with marital status in their impact on parents’ well-being. Most obviously, we would
expect the costs of children, both in economic and psychological terms, to be greater for
single parents than married parents (Glenn and Weaver 1979). In the case of divorced
parents the effects may be especially acute. It has been established, for example, that the
adjustment by mothers to divorce is negatively associated with the number of children
(e.g., Garvin, Kalter and Hansell 1993).
DATA AND METHOD
Sample
The data used in this analysis come from the first wave of the Household, Income and
Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. Described in more detail in Watson and
Wooden (2002a), the HILDA Survey is based on similar studies conducted in both
Germany and the UK (the German Socio-Economic Panel and the British Household
Panel Survey respectively). The HILDA Survey thus involved the selection of a large
nationally representative sample of households and then seeking interviews with
members of those households. Specifically, a household interview was sought with at
least one adult member. Individual interviews were then sought with all household
members over the age of 15 years on the 30 June preceding interview. In addition to the
collection of data through personal interview, all persons completing a personal interview
were given a self-completion questionnaire that they were asked to return after
completion either by mail or by handing it to the interviewer at a subsequent visit to the
household. Almost all of the interviews were conducted during the period between 24
August 2001 and 21 December 2001.
Households were selected into the sample by a multi-stage process. First, a random
sample of 488 Census Collection Districts (CDs), based on 1996 Census boundaries, was
selected from across Australia (each of which consists of approximately 200 to 250
households). Second, within each of these CDs all dwellings were fully enumerated and a
sample of 22 to 34 dwellings randomly selected.1
 Third, given dwellings can contain
more than one household, rules were devised for the selection of households within
dwellings. These rules stipulated that where a dwelling contained three or fewer
households, all such households should be sampled. Where there were four or more
households occupying one dwelling, all households had to be enumerated and a random
sample of three households obtained (based on a predetermined pattern).
After adjusting for out-of-scope dwellings (e.g., unoccupied, non-residential) and
households (e.g., all occupants were overseas visitors) and for multiple households within
dwellings, the total number of households identified as in-scope was 11,693. Interviews
were completed with all eligible members at 6872 of these households and with at least
one eligible member at a further 810 households. The total household response rate was,
therefore, 66 per cent.
Within the 7682 households at which interviews were conducted, there were 19,917
people. Of this group, 4790 were under 15 years of age on the preceding 30 June and
7
hence were ineligible for an interview in Wave 1. This left 15,127 persons eligible for a
personal interview, 13,969 of whom completed the Person Questionnaire.
As discussed in Wooden et al. (2002), these response rates compare favourably with the
rates achieved in the first waves of similar major household panel surveys. They are also
well in excess of the rates typically reported in other Australian surveys that have
attempted to measure life satisfaction. More importantly, comparison with population
benchmark data from official Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) sources suggests that
the sample has characteristics that are broadly in line with what would have been
expected if the sample were truly random. There is, however, at least one major disparity,
with residents from Sydney under-represented, a result that Wooden et al. (2002) attribute
to both greater difficulties making contact with some Sydney residents (e.g., those in
living in high-rise apartments) and a greater reluctance to participate because of time
commitments.
Measuring SWB
The dependent variable used in this analysis is a subjective measure of global life
satisfaction. It comprises a single item scored on a 0-10 scale. The item was worded as
follows:
“All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life?”
A visual aid (i.e., a show card) was then used to graphically portray the scale respondents
were to use in answering this question. Only the extreme values on the scale were
labelled, with a score of 0 described as “totally dissatisfied” and a score of 10 as “totally
satisfied”.
While single-item measures are often regarded as problematic, in the area of SWB it has
been well-established that single item measures perform as well as, if not better than,
multi-item measures (e.g., Andrews and Withey 1976). As a consequence, their use is
widespread. The item used here, for example, is very similar to an equivalent item that
has been asked as part of the German Socio-Economic Panel since 1984, and has formed
the basis for a number of studies into life satisfaction in that country (e.g., Winkelmann
and Winkelmann 1998, Clark et al. 2001, Frijters et al. 2002). It is also very close to the
overall life satisfaction item used in the World Values Survey (Inglehart et al. 2000).
A summary of the distribution of responses to the life satisfaction question is provided in
Table 1. As can be seen, responses are highly skewed towards high levels of satisfaction,
with the modal response being 8, but with almost 40 per cent selecting 9 or 10. Given the
possibility of bias as a result of self-selection (i.e., a tendency for the most happy to be
more likely to respond), we also report the distribution after weighting the population to
reflect established population norms. The distribution is almost identical, but with a very
small difference at the upper end of the distribution. In other words, the impact of selfselection on measured life satisfaction appears to be minimal.

In Table 2 we report mean life satisfaction scores (together with standard deviations)
disaggregated by sex, marital status and the presence of dependent children under the age
of 15 years. The figures reported in this table indicate that:
i. consistent with the figures reported in Table 1, weighting the data to population
norms has a very small and ultimately negligible impact on mean life satisfaction;
ii. women were slightly more likely to report higher levels of life satisfaction than
men, a result that is consistent with other recent evidence for Australia (see
Cummins et al. 2001);2

iii. in line with previous research, married people report noticeably higher levels of
life satisfaction than single persons, while the least satisfied of all are separated
and divorced persons; and
iv. for all gender and marital status groups, the presence of dependent children is
associated with noticeably lower levels of self-reported life satisfaction.
Method
A multivariate regression framework is used to identify and quantify the impact of family
characteristics on the level of life satisfaction. The dependent variable, however, does not
have the properties usually assumed for ordinary least squares estimation. The dependent
variable is a subjective assessment of an individual’s life satisfaction scored on an ordinal
scale, in this case ranging from 0 to 10. This variable is thus clearly not linear (since it is
truncated at 0 and 10) and there is the strong likelihood that least squares estimation
would give rise to out-of-range predictions (especially given the relatively large number
of cases at the upper limit). Furthermore, no significance can be attached to the unit
9
distance between the set of observed values on this scale. That is, it cannot be assumed
that the distance between say 8 and 9 on this scale is the same as the distance between 3
and 4. The ordered probit model was specifically developed for such situations and hence
is employed here. It is important to realise that while more conventional least squares
results provide qualitatively similar results (that is, the signs and significance levels on
explanatory variables are mostly unaffected by the choice of estimator), the estimated
magnitude of the impacts can and does vary quite noticeably.

In addition to controls for marital status and children, all estimated equations include an
extensive array of controls. While the make-up of the set of control variables is largely
data driven, the HILDA Survey dataset is very rich, and hence the set of variables
included here is very broad. Stack and Eshleman (1998), for example, are only able to
include controls for sex, age, church attendance, education, employment status,
subjective health and satisfaction with financial situation (and the last two of these
controls are clearly endogenous). In this analysis a more extensive array of controls are
available. Specifically, we include controls for: age, which following other recent
research (e.g., Clark et al. 2001, Frijters et al. 2002, Di Tella et al. 2003) is specified as a
quadratic; country of birth; English language ability; the presence of health conditions
and disabilities disaggregated by severity; education; employment status; the number of
other persons in the household (that is, other than a partner or own childen); household
10
income per ‘equivalised’ household member3
; home ownership; the importance of
religion (assessed on an 11-point scale); an individual’s discount rate (as represented by
the length of time horizon for savings and investment decisions); whether the respondent
was living with both of their own parents at age 14; locality (represented here by 487
dummy terms for each of the CDs sampled, less one omitted to act as the reference
group); the degree of suspicion about the interview (as assessed by the interviewer); and
the presence of other adults during the interview.
A common practice in research employing multiple regression analysis is to omit cases
where there is missing data on any variable of interest, raising the possibility of selection
bias. We largely avoid this problem by creating dummy variables identifying nonresponse on items where non-response is relatively high. This was of most importance
when dealing with household income. According to Watson and Wooden (2002b) an
estimate of total household gross income can only be derived in 71 per cent of cases in
the HILDA Survey sample, a result of both missing data on some income components
and non-respondents within households.
Finally, all models are estimated separately for men and women. As observed by Stack
and Eshleman (1998, p. 528), this is likely to be of particular importance for analyzing
the effects of marriage given widespread beliefs that marriage benefits men more than
women. More generally, the estimation of gender-specific models is becoming much
more widespread, with the hypothesis of parameter equality typically rejected in large
samples (e.g., Clark et al. 2001, Frijters et al. 2002).
RESULTS
The results from the ordered probit estimation of our basic model are reported in Table 3.
A summary of various extensions to this model is then reported in Table 4. The first point
to note about the results reported in Table 3 is that most of the coefficients on the control
variables are in line with both expectations and previous research. Thus we find that:
(i) age exhibits the U-shaped relationship with life satisfaction found in multivariate
research employing large samples (with life satisfaction lowest at around 44 years
for men and 42 years for women);
(ii) life satisfaction is lowest for persons from a non-English speaking background,
especially women, and especially if their English language speaking ability is poor;
(iii) the effects of education on life satisfaction, while relatively small, are negative,
possibly the result of high aspirations that have yet to be met (Clark and Oswald
1994);
(iv) levels of life satisfaction are strongly affected by the presence of health conditions
and disabilities that limit activity;
(v) persons not in employment but who are actively looking for work (that is, the
unemployed) express the highest levels of dissatisfaction, while the most satisfied
are persons who are neither employed nor looking for work (so long as this
situation is not the result of poor health);
11
(vi) the presence of persons other than immediate family members in the household has
predictable effects, with children enhancing satisfaction of men but reducing it for
women, and adults enhancing satisfaction of women but not men;
(vii) satisfaction levels rise with household income per head, though the magnitudes of
the estimated coefficients suggest that the effect is relatively small and that very
large increases in income are required to raise life satisfaction scores by even one
point on the scale;
(viii) homeowners tend to be more satisfied with their lives than renters;
(ix) religion tends to be an influence that enhances life satisfaction;
(x) persons who are more forward looking in their financial planning and savings
behaviour are more satisfied, though the effect is only pronounced among women;
and
(xi) more stable home environments when young (as represented by living with two
parents at age 14) are associated with greater levels of life satisfaction.
One unexpected finding is the coefficient on the indigenous identifier. Other things held
constant, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men score higher on the life satisfaction
scale than non-indigenous men. Moreover, the size of the effect is relatively large.
Among indigenous women, the size of the differential is smaller, and statistically
insignificant.
The second point about these results that should be noted is that while the overall
explanatory power of model is impressive, we nevertheless are still only explaining a
minority of the variation in the dependent variable. This is not particularly surprising and
is consistent with the view that by far the most important predictors of variations across
individuals in well-being are unobserved influences, and especially personality traits.
The third point to note is that while the types of influences on life satisfaction are broadly
the same for men as they are for women, as hypothesized, the magnitude of the estimated
coefficients are different, and a formal test provides strong support for rejecting the
hypothesis of parameter equality.4

We turn now to the results on the variables at the center of this analysis.
Marital Status
Looking first at the estimated coefficient on the variable representing married persons we
find, consistent with previous research, that married persons are indeed more satisfied
with their lives than non-married persons. Note further that the magnitude of the
estimated coefficient in the male equation is not significantly different from that in the
female equation. In other words, there is little support in these data for the hypothesis that
marriage benefits men more than it does women.
These results also suggest that the adverse effects of marital disruption on SWB may not
be as large, and certainly not as long lived, as is usually assumed. While it is true that
persons who are currently single as a result of a separation or divorce are the least
satisfied, compared with other single persons the size of the effect is only significant for
women, and even then the effect largely disappears by the time a divorce is finalized. In
12
other words, after an initial adjustment period, levels of life satisfaction among divorcees
are no different than among other single people who have never married.
Marriage vs Cohabitation
The results reported in Table 3 suggest that the advantages from marriage for SWB
mainly flow through the benefits from companionship rather than from some
commitment effect. As with persons living in registered marriages, persons cohabiting (or
living in de facto marriages) are also more likely, other things held constant, to report
being satisfied with their lives than persons without a partner. Furthermore, while the
estimated coefficients suggest that persons in formal marriages are, on average, more
satisfied than persons in de facto marriages, the size of that differential is not large
enough to achieve statistical significance at conventional levels. This finding provides
some support for our hypothesis that differences between married relationships and
cohabiting relationships in 2001 are likely to be relatively small.
Of note, this result does appear to be sensitive to model specification. In particular, the
gap between the coefficients on the married and cohabitant dummies widens noticeably
when the location dummies are excluded suggesting that there is a tendency for married
and cohabiting couples to live in distinctly different locations, and it may be these
differing patterns of residential location that explain part of the raw differential in SWB
between married and cohabiting couples.
Marriage and Partnership Duration
To examine the question of whether or not the higher levels of life satisfaction reported
by both married and cohabiting persons declines over time, we augmented the basic
specification with measures of marriage duration and duration of cohabitation. As can be
seen from panel I in Table 4, some limited evidence in support of the hypothesis that
overall life satisfaction declines with duration of partnership among both married and
cohabiting couples was found. Among married persons, however, the effect was only
significant for men and even then the relationship was relatively weak. In contrast,
duration effects were much more important for cohabiting relationships. Further, we
found evidence of a curvilinear relationship (which we suspect reflects selection effects)
with life satisfaction beginning to rise for long-term cohabiting couples (after about 10 to
11 years together). We admit, however, that cross-section data provides at best a crude
test of duration effects, especially given the high correlation between the duration
variables and age.
Finally, it also should be noted that once years of marital and cohabiting duration are
controlled for, the relatively small difference in life satisfaction between persons in these
two different types of relationships disappears. In other words, differences in life
satisfaction between persons in marriages and in cohabitations do exist, but the difference
is only significant when comparing partnerships that are relatively long lasting.
Time Elapsed Following Separation and Divorce
As already noted, the differences in life satisfaction between divorced persons and other
otherwise comparable single persons are not large (and never statistically significant). It
thus should not be surprising that we find little impact from including variables
representing the time elapsed since separation. Again the results are reported as part of
13
panel I in Table 4. A weakly significant association was found for men but not for
women. Overall, the results suggest that the short-term negative impact of separation is
more marked for women, but most women have almost completely adjusted by the time
divorce is finalized. In contrast, for men the negative impact of separation, while weaker,
is more protracted.
Previous Marriages
We next tested whether life satisfaction varies with the number of times married. We also
distinguished between previous marriages that ended as a result of marital separation and
divorce or that those that ceased a result of the death of a partner. This distinction,
however, did not appear to matter and hence the results are not reported here.
A summary of the key coefficients is provided in panel II of Table 4. The results are
striking. Women in their second or subsequent marriage are no more (or less) satisfied
with their lives than comparable women still in their first marriage. In contrast, for men
there is a clear pattern of life satisfaction scores rising with each successive marriage,
particularly where the previous marriage was terminated by separation and divorce. In
other words, while marriage in general may not benefit men more than it does women,
remarriage would seem to.
Again, however, we urge caution in the interpretation of these results. First, the
differences between these coefficients for men are only significant at the 90 per cent
confidence level. Second, despite the extensive array of controls included in our model,
we cannot be sure that we are comparing like with like when we compare the coefficients
on first marriages with those on subsequent marriages. To be sure of this we really need
panel data. Nevertheless, the usual presumption is that any selection effects should cause
the estimates on happiness in first marriages to be biased upwards (since less satisfied
people will tend to be relatively more numerous among the divorced), which would only
strengthen the results presented here.
As a complement to these results, we also looked at whether life satisfaction differs
among cohabitants according to whether or not those cohabitants were previously
married or not. In this case, however, whether the previous marriage ended as a result of
divorce or because of the partner’s death did appear to matter, especially for men.
Specifically, the point estimates suggest that cohabitation does tend to help offset the
adverse effects of both separation and widowhood on life satisfaction, though the
coefficients are only large enough to achieve statistical significance (when compared
with cohabitants who have never married) for male widowers.
Children
Consistent with most recent research, the results reported here suggest that the SWB of
parents is adversely affected by the presence of dependent children in the household with
these negative effects rising with the number of children. Somewhat surprisingly,
however, there was little evidence that the size of the effect varied with the age of those
dependent children.5 What is clear is that there is a marked difference between dependent
children, who impact negatively on life satisfaction, and independent children who live in
the parental home, who have no impact. Such findings underscore the importance of
economic considerations in influencing SWB. Life satisfaction is also clearly enhanced
14
by the presence of adult children who have left home. Moreover, the magnitudes of these
positive coefficients are very similar in size to the negative coefficient on the dependent
children variable. In other words, much of the gains to parenting (at least from the
perspective of the parent) take many years to be realized. Thus in contrast to much of the
earlier research which implied that parenting was not a rational decision, these findings
suggest the reverse – from the perspective of the parent, children are an investment in
their future well-being. That said, without panel data that extend over an individual’s life
cycle we cannot be certain that these results are not simply the result of cohort effects
(since people with adult children will tend to come from an older cohort than those with
younger children).
Also of interest, our results suggest that parents’ well-being is inversely related to the
number of young children who do not live with the parent (e.g., as a result of custodial
arrangement following marital separation). The coefficient is particularly large for
women, but the relatively small number of women in this situation in our sample renders
the estimate very imprecise. Even for men, who are much more likely to be the noncustodial parent following separation, the coefficient is only significant at the 90 per cent
confidence level.
Children and Marital Status
The final extension of our life satisfaction reported here involved interacting both the
number of dependent children living at home and the number of adult children living
elsewhere with marital status. The results are reported in panel III of Table 4. Note that
for this analysis we included dependent students between the ages of 15 and 24 in the
definition of dependent child.
As can be clearly seen, the effects of children on parents’ life satisfaction vary markedly
with parents’ marital status. As expected, the negative effect of dependent children is
especially marked for single parents, and especially those who have never been married
(though due to relatively small numbers, the effect is only statistically significant for
mothers). At the other extreme, the number of dependent children has no effect at all on
the overall life satisfaction of married mothers. Note also that while the life satisfaction
of married and cohabiting couples was not found to be noticeably different, the two
groups would appear to be different, especially if female. While children do not impact
adversely on the satisfaction of married mothers they do on that of mothers in cohabiting
unions.
The positive impact of adult children on satisfaction is also not constant across marital
groups. It is generally most positive for married persons and for widows and widowers.
They also enhance the satisfaction of divorcees, but only the men. Adult children
generally do not enhance the satisfaction of persons cohabiting or persons who have
never married. Indeed for men in the latter category the presence of such children has a
marked negative impact on their life satisfaction score.

SUMMARY
• Couples are, on average, much more satisfied with their lives than single persons.
• Any difference in life satisfaction between married couples and cohabiting
couples is small and confined to long-standing relationships.
• Differences in life satisfaction between formerly married persons and other single
persons are only marked for women, and even then the reported life satisfaction
scores of most of these women have almost completely recovered to the level of
other single women by the time divorce is finalized.
• Remarriage appears to benefit men more than women, with the life satisfaction of
married men rising with each subsequent marriage. In contrast, women are no
more (or less) happy in a second marriage.
• Life satisfaction declines with the number of dependent children living at home
but rises with the number of adult children who have left home.
• Dependent children who live elsewhere have a depressing effect on life
satisfaction (though large standard errors mean relatively little confidence can be
attached to this result).
• The negative effects of young dependent children are very large for single parents
but non-existent for married mothers.

 The number of selections made varied with the expected response and occupancy rates within each

 The general consensus in the international literature is that reported differences in SWB between men
and women, which typically favour women, disappear once other demographic variables are controlled
for (Diener et al. 1999, p. 292). Recent studies employing large national samples, however, have
generally found that significant gender differences remains after inclusion of demographic controls
(e.g., Stack and Eshleman 1998, Marks and Fleming 1999, Frijters et al. 2002, Blanchflower and
Oswald 2003, Di Tella et al. forthcoming). 3
 We use the modified OECD equivalence scale, which assigns a value of 1 to the first adult, 0.5 to all
other adults, and 0.3 to children (defined here as persons under the age of 15 years). As is
conventional, we also specify income as a log function. 4
 A likelihood ratio test for equality of parameters resulted in a chi-squared statistic of 3105.5, well in
excess of the critical level needed to reject the hypothesis of parameter equality. 5
 We disaggregated the variable for dependent children to distinguish between children aged less than
one year, between 1 and 4 years and between 5 and 14 years and could find no clear evidence that the
age of dependent children mattered for life satisfaction. Further, this was also true when the variables
were reconstructed as simple dummies signalling the presence of such children rather than the number.
