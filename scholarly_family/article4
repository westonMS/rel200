BY WHAT MEASURE? FAMILY TIME DEVOTED TO
CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES*

We argue that previous research on time devoted to child care has paid insufficient attention to
the conceptualization ofcare time. Three separate problems are evident. First, the conventional focus on explicit activities with children distracts attention from the larger responsibilities of "passive" care, which ranges from time when children are sleeping to time when they are in the same
general area but are not engaged in an activity with parents. Second, the empirical analysis ofactivity time focuses almost exclusively on parents, overlooking the role ofrelatives such as grandmothers and siblings. Third, the measurement of active care time often ignores the impact of overlaps
among both care providers and recipients. Our analysis ofthe Child Development Supplement ofthe
Panel Study ofIncome Dynamics sheds light on these three problems and presents new measures of
passive and active care time.
In intellectual exchange, as in properly economic transactions, numbers are the
medium through which dissimilar desires, needs, and expectations are somehow made
commensurable.
-Porter (1995:86)
How much family time is devoted to the care of children in the United States? An accurate answer to this question could help quantify the adult effort devoted to the production
ofthe next generation. It could also help explain why children who live with single parents
seem disadvantaged relative to their counterparts in two-parent households (McLanahan
and Sandefur 1994). Large-scale diary-based surveys are providing more and more numbers about time use. But the validity ofthese numbers rests on typologies and taxonomies
of care that deserve closer attention than they have yet received (Bailey 1994).
Most time-diary surveys ask adults about their participation in activities with children, overlooking the demands of supervisory time, or "passive care." Survey designs
typically focus on parents or family members living in the same household, rather than
the total amount of unpaid care provided by family members (including those living in
different households). Measures of active care ignore the issue of overlap, treating an
hour of adult care time the same whether it is accompanied by other adults or devoted to
one or more children.
In this article, we use the unique features of a child-based survey, the 1997 Child
Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID-CDS), to

explain these shortcomings and develop better measures of family care time devoted to
children in the United States in 1997. We begin with a discussion of the implicit concept
of child care that is built into time-diary methods of data collection. We develop a new
typology of passive and active care time to better analyze the total time devoted to children. We show the extent of overlap in active care time and develop a measure of care
density that has important implications for analyzing the overall quantity of family time
devoted to children.
CONCEPTUALIZING CHILD CARE TIME
Time-use diaries are often treated as simple instruments for the collection of data. But
these diaries, which ask respondents to record activities undertaken within the past 24
hours, embody the assumption that time should be categorized in terms of activities, rather
than of responsibilities or constraints. Also, when they measure care time, they typically
measure what is "given," rather than of what is "received." The basic time-diary approach
has changed little since it was widely applied in the 1970s (Szalai 1973). Following this
precedent, most recent studies of adult time use in the United States have asked individuals to categorize their day in terms of specific activities (Juster and Stafford 1985;
Robinson and Godbey 1997).
This focus provides important insights into the ways in which adults spend their time.
But the provision of care for children and other dependents entails a complex interaction
between providers and recipients of care. Not all child care takes the form of a distinct
activity, and children are often cared for by more than one person at a time. Most empirical
studies of child care time in the United States that were based on time diaries have reported
the time that parents spend in activities with children (Bianchi 2000; Bianchi and Robinson
1997). The PSID-CDS, administered in 1997, offers a new and unique vantage point that is
based on the experience of children, rather than parents (Hofferth 2001; Sandberg and
Hofferth 2001). Even this survey, however, retains an emphasis on child care as an activity,
rather than as both an activity and a responsibility (Budig and Folbre 2004).
Active and Passive Care
The activities that are categorized in time-use surveys typically include paid work, housework (including child care), travel, personal care, and sleep. The purpose ofthe activity is
considered less important than the activity itself. Cooking a meal for a child is coded as
housework, and shopping for clothes for a child is coded as shopping. Only activities that
involve direct interaction with a child are coded as child care. But responsibility for young
children often transcends particular activities, imposing constraints on adults' schedules.
Leaving a child younger than age 9 without adult supervision, even when the child is fast
asleep, can be legally construed as neglect. l "Out of sight" does not imply "out of mind"
(Leslie, Anderson, and Branson 1991).
Time-use diaries can accommodate multitasking by allowing the respondents to designate both a primary and a secondary activity. When secondary activities are included,
time devoted to child care increases dramatically. But secondary time remains "activity
based." Furthermore, the reporting ofsecondary activity time devoted to children has varied considerably across surveys, depending on how the activities were defined (Budig
and Folbre 2004). Recognition of the difficulties of measuring time devoted to child care
is growing. The survey ofthe Australian Bureau of Statistics (1997:37) went further than
1. According to the National Child Care Information Center web site (www.nccic.org/faqs/
homealone.html), there is no simple answer to the question, "at what age maya child be left alone and for how
long? However, many states and municipalities have guidelines that stipulate that children younger than age 8
should not be left alone for any period of time. U.S. Army guidelines require direct supervision onsite by an
adult or an adult-designated teenager aged 13 or older for all children aged 10 and younger.
Family Time Devoted to Children 375
any other survey in insisting that "passive" forms of care should be considered, defining
them broadly to include "monitoring children playing outside or sleeping, preserving a
safe environment, being an adult presence for children to turn to in need, supervising
games or swimming activities including swimming lessons."
Statistics Canada administers a national time-use survey that omits the consideration
of secondary activities but includes stylized questions regarding care time. In its recently
inaugurated American Time Use Survey (ATUS), the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics asks
each respondent to estimate how many hours during the survey day children were "in
their care" (Schwartz 2002). Yet even the ATUS restricts respondents to periods in which
the adult and at least one child were awake.
The PSID-CDS reaches further than most surveys by asking, in addition to "Who was
doing the activity with the child?," "Who (else) was there but not directly involved in the
activity?" Unfortunately, however, this survey excludes children's sleep and personal care
time from consideration, resulting in an underestimate of time that parents are "there but
not directly involved."2 An important component of passive care time escapes explicit
measurement, although, as our analysis will show, it can be measured as a residual.
Providers of Active Care and Overlaps Among Them
It is not surprising that most studies of time devoted to activities with children have focused on parents. Although it is generally recognized that grandparents and other adult
relatives often help out with children and that older siblings may supervise younger ones,
such contributions are difficult to capture. Even if all adults living in a household are
surveyed, those living outside the household (including noncustodial parents) are excluded. Only a child-centric time-diary survey, such as the PSID-CDS, can account for
care provided by extrahousehold family members and friends.
Most adult-based time-use surveys that have been conducted have failed to include
an explicit consideration of overlaps. It is seldom possible to ascertain whether the time
an adult spends with a child coincides with the time spent by another adult or whether
more than one child is being cared for at a time. 3 As a result, the reported results can be
confusing, if not misleading. For instance, a reported average of 12 hours per week for
mothers and 4 hours per week for fathers can represent a total of 12 hours in which the
child was in parental care (a complete overlap) or a total of 16 hours (no overlap).
Furthermore, a mother who provides care for 12 hours per week may be caring for one
child-or for several children-during those hours.
Children may benefit from the additional time and attention they receive when two or
more adults are participating in an activity with them, from the lower stress level on adult
caregivers, and from the opportunity to watch adults interact with one another. Fuligni
and Brooks-Gunn (2004) described several aspects of parental overlap and sequential
caregiving for young children in the PSID-CDS. It is often easier and more enjoyable to
provide care when the adult-child ratio is high. Studies of adult time-use allocation have
shown that spouses prefer to spend time outside of paid employment together, but that the
presence of young children often leads them to economize by taking turns providing care
(Hamermesh 2000, 2002). Parents who work split shifts to reduce their child care costs
are sacrificing overlap time with one another partly to reduce the costs of paid care (Kiser
2002; Presser 1994).
2. Note that the exclusion of personal care activities also understates primary child care that involves
washing, bathing, and going to the bathroom-time that is not insignificant for young children (time devoted to
"potty training" for instance, is often substantial).
3. The 1998 Bianchi/Robinson survey included the question "who else was participating?" While analyses
of these data have been limited, the data revealed important differences in the quality of leisure time experienced by men and women (Mattingly and Bianchi 2003).
376 Demography, Volume 42-Number 2, May 2005
The implications of child overlaps are more difficult to interpret. On the one hand,
the presence of an older child, especially one who is able to assist adults to some extent
with a younger child, can increase the quality of care and reduce the demands on the
adult. The presence of an additional child also provides opportunities for supervised interaction with peers that are likely to have positive effects. On the other hand, the participation of a younger child increases competition for adult attention and therefore dilutes
the quality of the adult care that the child receives. Caring for more than one child at a
time is often more demanding and stressful for an adult than one-on-one activities. But it
is obviously cheaper in terms of opportunity cost (earnings or income forgone as a result
of adult time devoted to child care).
Overlaps can be described as an aspect of the density of care, defined as the ratio of
adults to young children participating in an activity, per unit oftime. Density is increased
by adult overlaps and decreased by child overlaps. In general, high density reduces the
intensity of demands on adults, shifting their care activities more in the direction ofshared
interaction, perhaps even leisure time. But high density is costly because it implies higher
quantities of adult care time per child. The growth of paid child care services reduces the
density of care, since ratios of adults to children are typically lower in public settings
than in the home. Within a certain range, decreases in density may actually improve quality, since children have more opportunities to interact with one another. But regulatory
limits on adult-child ratios for paid child care providers are put in place primarily to
defend a minimum threshold of care density.
Whatever its limitations, a measure ofthe average density of care per unit oftime can
provide insights into trends that are easily obscured by a reliance on the measurement of
trends in the average amount of parental care per child, which are occasionally cited in
the time-use literature (Bryant and Zick 1996b:373, 386). The average amount of parental
care time per child has gone up in the United States as the average number of children per
family has gone down. Compare a two-parent family with three children in which the
parents provide a total of 48 hours of care per week (16 hours per child) with a twoparent family with two children in which the parents provide a total of 40 hours of care
per week (20 hours per child).
At first glance, it may seem that parental care density, as well as care time per child,
must be higher in the second case. But it is not necessarily so if the extent of overlap
between mothers' and fathers' care time differs. For instance, assume that the second family just described allocates its care time so that it never overlaps (each parent cares for two
children for 20 hours a week). With one adult always caring for two children, the average
parental care density is 1/2. Average care density for the first family just described could
be higher if parental time overlaps to a high degree. For instance, if both the mother and
the father provided 24 hours of care at the same time, average care density would be 2/3.
The overlap need not be 100% for this to occur. With one parent caring for three children,
parental care density averages 1/3; with two parents caring for three children, parental care
density averages 2/3. These densities will average to exactly 1/2 if exactly 1/2 the time that
the children spend with at least one parent involves the other parent.
DATA AND METHODS
The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal survey of a representative
sample of U.S. men, women, and children and the families in which they live. 4 In 1997,
the Child Development Supplement (CDS) collected information on one or two randomly
selected 0- to 12-year-old children of the PSID respondents from the primary caregiver
4. See http://psidonline.isLumich.edu/CDS/researchdesign.html for details.
Family Time Devoted to Children 377
and from the children themselves. 5 A total of 3,563 children were included; 2,904 completed at least one diary, yielding a response rate of 81.5%. The survey instrument asked
parents, teachers, and children, when appropriate, to designate the activities that the children were engaged in during two 24-hour periods, one a weekday and the other a weekend ("What did your child do?").
Respondents to the CDS have already been included in at least one PSID interview.
The majority of respondents come from long-time PSID respondent families. Eligibility
for the CDS is based on the ages of the PSID family's children. Our analysis used childlevel weights from the CDS demographic file to adjust for family selection and nonresponse factors.
Measurement of Time Use
The time-diary data have a unique case ID and multiple observations per child, each referring to activities over a 24-hour period. The respondents were asked to designate the
child's activity, the duration of that activity, who was participating in the activity, and
who else was available. The main respondent in each case was the primary caregiver,
usually the child's mother. 6 Interviewers visited the household and reviewed and edited
the time diaries. The survey was not administered during July and August because of the
summer vacation.
Two 24-hour time diaries were collected for almost every child, one during a weekday and one during a weekend. We constructed weekly averages by weighting weekday
data by a factor of 5 and the weekend data by a factor of 2. The exclusion of activities of
sleeping and personal care from consideration is apparent from the survey instrument,
which explicitly states in the heading above the participation and the availability columns
in capital letters DO NOT ANSWER IF SLEEPING OR PERSONAL CARE. These
activities comprised seven specific activity codes, including "waking up," "washing,
showering, bathing," "dressing," "medical care at home to self," "night sleep," "naps and
resting," and "personal, private, 'none of your business. ,"
Our examination ofthe data revealed that the participation and availability categories
are not always mutually exclusive. In 104 segments of child time, a mother or a father was
coded as "participating" but also coded as "available but not participating." We believe
that this represents a coding error, and we recoded these activities as time "participating."
In most cases, we coded missing values as zeros so as not to reject child-level observations that lacked only a small amount of information about specific activities. However, in 16 cases, no activity was listed for a child for an entire day (over a span of 24
hours). We excluded these day-length records from consideration. Two children for whom
both sample days were excluded were dropped from the data set.
Measurement of Participation and Availability
Ten categories ofindividuals were coded as "participating" or "available": mother, father,
sibling, stepmother, stepfather, stepsibling, child's friend, grandparent, other relative, or
other nonrelative. Ofthese 10, only 4 (mother, father, stepmother, and stepfather) refer to
unique individuals. The other 6 categories could include more than one person. We included stepmothers in the mother category, stepfathers in the father category, and
stepsiblings in the sibling category.
5. About 67% of the time diaries for the children were filled out by the mothers or primary caregivers
alone; about 12%, by the mothers and primary caregivers together; 8%, by the children alone; and 9%, by
someone else.
6. Reliance on the mother's reports may introduce gender bias, such as the underreporting of paternal time.
We see no way of assessing the possible extent of such a bias.
378 Demography, Volume 42-Number 2, May 2005
In the PSID, each family unit has only one current head. The head must be at least 16
years old and the person with the most financial responsibility for the family unit. If this
person is female and she has a husband in the family unit, then he is typically designated
as the head. If she has a boyfriend with whom she has been living for at least one year,
then he is typically designated as the head. However, ifthe husband or boyfriend is incapacitated and unable to fulfill the functions of the head, then the family unit will have a
female head.
The "other nomelative" category may include a cohabiting partner, such as a live-in
boyfriend. An adult cohabiter is labeled a boyfriend or girlfriend (code 88) the first time
he or she appears in the sample. But if the cohabiter remains in the family unit at the next
interview, the label is switched to either "wife" or "head." Thus, cohabiters "disappear."
Since the PSID-CDS is based on families who have already been interviewed at least
once, it includes few cohabiters (only a cohabiter who joined a family unit since its last
interview would show up as such).
The coding nomenclature sometimes makes it difficult to ascertain whether persons
who are designated as "relatives" and "nomelatives" are adults or children. We assumed
that mothers, stepmothers, fathers, stepfathers, and grandparents were adults. We also
assumed that "other nomelatives" were adults, since child "friend" is a separate category
among nomelatives and because most "other nomelatives" seem to involve market transactions, such as baby-sitting after school, for appointments with physicians, or for
attendance at public events. The most ambiguous category is "other relative," which may
include cousins (children) as well as aunts and uncles (adults). To construct a reasonable
estimate, we assumed that the "availability" of an adult during the time that a child spent
participating in an activity with an "other relative" is an indicator that the "other
relative" was likely to be another child. However, if no adult was listed as available, we
assumed that the "other relative" participating in an activity with a child was an adult.
ANALYSIS PLAN
Our goal was to reconceptualize the data collected in the PSID-CDS to develop improved
measures of both the passive and active care that children receive. We defined passive
child care from the child's point of view, as the time in which no adult was directly participating in an activity with the child but at least one adult was likely to be playing a
supervisory role. This definition is broader than one based only on the actual "availability" of an adult, as was directly recorded in the survey.
We distinguished among three different types of passive child care on a continuum
that reflects the intensity of demands on adults who provide care. Time excluded from
consideration in the PSID-CDS because a child was sleeping or engaging in personal care
is the least intensive. But we assumed that it nonetheless represents a form of passive
care, since children younger than age 12 require supervision or monitoring by an adult
who must be somewhere in the vicinity. This category of time can be calculated as a
residual: the difference between time that is accounted for in the survey and the 24 hours
in a day.
The second category consists of time young children spent alone or with another
child, during which no adult was listed as either available or participating. This is time
that is measured in the PSID-CDS, but is not generally considered passive care because
no category of adult was actually named as providing care. The third category of passive
care, which corresponds to that used by previous researchers who have used the PSIDCDS (Sandberg and Hofferth 2001), is time in which an adult was listed as available, but
no adult was participating in an activity with a child.
We defined active child care time as the time in which at least one adult was directly
participating in an activity with a child. This definition is identical to that used by
Sandberg and Hofferth (2001). However our attention to the multiplicity of caregivers
Family Time Devoted to Children 379
and recipients threatens a daunting complexity. In the PSID-CDS, it is common for three
or more people to be listed as participating in an activity with a child. Even with only
three people, seven combinations are possible. For instance, consider a child who engaged in activities with a mother, a grandparent, and an adult nonrelative. The seven combinations are time with the mother alone, time with a grandparent alone, time with an
adult nonrelative alone, time with the mother and a grandparent only, time with the mother
and an adult nonrelative only, time with a grandparent and an adult nonrelative only, and
time with the mother, a grandparent, and an adult nonrelative. With four people, 15 combinations are possible, and with five, 81 combinations!7
To simplify this picture, we assumed that, among caregivers, mothers take priority
over fathers, fathers take priority over nonparental relatives, and nonparental relatives
take priority over adult nonrelatives. We assigned care to the lower-priority caregiver only
if the higher-priority caregiver was not also listed. For instance, the father was assigned
active care time only ifthe mother was not also providing active care, and a nonparental
relative was assigned active care time only if no parent was providing active care. This
provides a clear picture of a "pyramid" of active care time in which those with the highest
priority (parents) represent the "base." A separate look at overlaps among different care
providers and recipients provides additional information concerning the density of the
care pyramid as a whole. The results were disaggregated for children in one- and twoparent families and for children in four different age groups.
Conventional methods of testing the statistical significance of differences in means
cannot be used for survey data, like those ofPSID-CDS, which is characterized by cluster
sampling, stratification, and the use of sampling weights. Our statistical tests were based
on ordinary least-squares models in which care time is treated as the dependent variable
and characteristics such as the household structure and the age of children are treated as
dummy variables, using procedures to correct for the lack of independence among observations that include more than one child from a family.s
RESULTS
Table 1 and Figure 1 provide an overview of average weekly passive and active care time
in absolute and percentage terms for all children in our sample. Time in which children
are sleeping or engaging in personal care amounts to almost half the time in a child's
week and more than half for children aged 2 or younger. The exclusion ofthis category of
passive care from consideration can create a misleading picture of the economic constraints on families, leading to the erroneous conclusion that infants require less time than
older children simply because they are less likely to be awake at any given time.
As one may expect, children spend a relatively small percentage oftheir waking time
without an adult available, on average about 5%. Time in which an adult is available but
no adult is participating in an activity with a child is also relatively small, about 13%.
While the measure of adult availability provided in the PSID-CDS indicates the degree of
social support or "backup" available to someone who is participating in a care activity, it
represents only a small proportion ofthe total passive care that a child receives.
Table 1 shows that active care is provided in similar proportions in both two-parent
and single-parent families (between 35% and 34% of the total time), suggesting that
single-parent families may draw on other family members or friends to help provide active care. However, the table also shows a significant difference in the amount of time
that children in single-parent families and children in two-parent families spend in passive care in which no adult is listed as available (IDA hours per week compared with 7.6

hours per week). This difference may reflect the fact that children in single-parent families are, on average, slightly older than those in two-parent families (6.4 years versus 5.9
years, a statistically significant difference). Children can, of course, care for themselves
to some extent, as is indicated by the increase in this category with age, from 4.5 hours
per week for the youngest to 12.1 for the oldest. But even young children aged 0-2 were
reported spending on average 4.5 hours per week during which they were not sleeping or
in personal care but no adult was either providing active care or listed as available.
Active Care Time and Adult Responsibility
On average, children participate in activities with one or more adults for 59 hours per
week, or 35% of their time (see Table 1). Active care time increases slightly as children
reach the middle age groups, probably because they are sleeping less, a factor that counterbalances the increase in the likelihood ofspending more time alone or with another child.
To analyze the different categories of persons who simultaneously participate in activities with children, we abstracted from overlaps and assigned time to the person who is
likely to bear the greatest responsibility. Table 2 portrays the average time children spend
participating in activities with others according to this hierarchy. Of the average amount
oftime in which a child is participating in an activity with an adult (59 hours per week, as
indicated in Table 1), 29 hours represent active care by at least one parent, and about 3
hours represent active care by an adult relative other than a parent. Adult nonrelatives
(such as paid baby-sitters, child care providers, and teachers) provide almost as much
active care as parents, about 27 hours per week.
Children in one-parent families receive less active care from a parent than do those in
two-parent families, a statistically significant difference of 24 hours per week compared
with 31 hours (see Table 2). Also significant is the greater amount of active care these

Family Time Devoted to Children 383
children receive from adult relatives other than a parent, 3.8 hours per week compared
with 2.4 for children in two-parent families. Overall, about 42% of the active care that
children in one-parent families receive is provided by parents, compared with about 52%
for children in two-parent families. Children aged 12 and younger participate in activities
with relatives other than parents for more than 3 hours per week.
Comparisons across age groups show that the average percentage of active care that
children receive from parents drops considerably when they reach age 3 and again when
they reach age 6, probably as a result of preschool and school-related transitions. Children
aged 2 or younger enjoy about twice the amount of active care from parents as do 9- to 12
year olds. The time that children spend receiving active care from a relative other than a
parent goes down after they reach age 6 (see Table 2).
What about the time that children spend receiving active care from a parent? Table 3
disaggregates this time, following the same hierarchical ordering as Table 2, first assigning time that both parents are participating to the mother on the grounds that she is likely
to assume the greatest responsibility. This provides a measure of mothers' active care
time that could be compared with the results from adult-based surveys, such as those
analyzed by Bianchi (2000).9 Children spend, on average, about 24 hours per week receiving active care from their mothers (with or without the participation of their fathers)
and almost 5 hours per week receiving active care from their fathers, but not their mothers. Children in two-parent households receive about twice as much active care from their
fathers alone as do children in single-parent households, and all these differences between children in single-parent and two-parent households are statistically significant. As
a comparison with Table 2 shows, however, active care from fathers alone is similar in
magnitude to active care from nonparental relatives. Time in which both mothers and
fathers jointly provide active care averages about 8 hours per week.
Contrary to what may be expected, fathers spend more time alone participating with
infants and toddlers than with older children (see Table 3). This finding may reflect the
greater need to provide active care for infants (e.g., to give mothers a break) and the more
"social" character of time spent with older children, which is likely to take the form of
family activities in which the mothers are also participating. Previous research on the
PSID-CDS has suggested that fathers are more likely to spend time with children on weekends, partially compensating for the large number ofhours they spend in paid employment
during the week (Fuligni and Brooks-Gunn 2004; Yeung et al. 2001).
Overlaps of Care Time
About a third of the active care that children receive, on average, involves overlaps of
either adults or children. As Table 4 indicates, about 65% of the active care a child receives from an adult does not involve another person. However, about 14% ofthe time, at
least one other adult is providing active care; and about 2% ofthe time, at least two other
adults are doing so. This finding implies that for every 100 hours oftime in which a child
is receiving active care from at least one adult, at least 118 hours of adult active care time
are being provided (100 plus 14 plus 4). Additional adults are less likely to be present for
children in single-parent families, and these differences are statistically significant.
Table 5 focuses more specifically on overlaps of parental active care, disaggregating
the time children spend with at least one parent by overlaps with other types of persons.
Parents are more likely than adults in general to provide overlapping care. Only about
41% ofthe active care a child receives from one parent does not include participation by
another person. Another parent is participating 26% of this time, and an adult relative is
participating about 4% of this time. Nonrelative time accounts for an additional 3% (the
9. Differences in the age categories of children prevent a direct comparison here.

Family Time Devoted to Children 387
overlap is small here because nomelatives are generally paid care providers or teachers
who are substituting for parents). Children in single-parent families are significantly more
likely than children in two-parent families to be cared for by the combination of a parent
and an adult relative and significantly less likely to be cared for by two parents at once.
On average, another adult is participating 33% of the time that at least one parent is
providing active care. This finding implies that, on average, for every 100 hours in which
a child receives active care from at least one parent, at least 33 additional hours of adult
active care time are being supplied. Another child is participating about 25% of this time,
typically a sibling (which accounted for 22%). That is, on average, of every 100 hours in
which a child receives care, another child is present at least 25 hours. Since these descriptive statistics do not take the number of other participants into account, they provide only
a rough indicator of density: the ratio of time in which there is more than one adult divided by the time in which there is more than one child is 1.33 to 1.25, or about 1.1. The
amount of time in which an adult is not participating in an activity but is "available"
represents another, more diffuse form of overlap, but one that seems less relevant to density than do overlaps of active care.
Care Density
We defined the density of active family care time as the number of parents or adult relatives who participated in an activity with a child divided by the number of children who
participated. lO Similarly, we defined the density of active parental care time as the number of parents who participate in an activity with a child divided by the number of children who participate. We averaged this figure over all the activities in a child's week,
weighted by the amount of time in those activities, to calculate the average density of
active family and parental care time for an individual child.
Our measure ofthe number ofindividuals providing direct care is approximate because
the data do not provide a count ofthe individuals who participated, only a categorization.
For instance, if a sibling was recorded as participating, it may indicate that one, two, or
more siblings were participating. This measurement problem would be particularly serious
for an estimate ofthe overall density of adult time with children because nomelatives such
as teachers and child care workers often participate in activities with a large number of
children, who would go uncounted. But it is less serious when family and parental care are
concerned, since the number of adults and children who are involved is smaller. The fact
that family members are categorized in more detail than nomelatives makes an accurate
count more feasible. There is only one "mother," one "father," one "stepmother," and so
forth. Even though there are theoretically two grandmothers and two grandfathers, it seems
unlikely that both members of such a category would be engaging in an activity with
children without the parents present. The measurement problem reduces the overall variation ofthe index, but still provides a better picture than the conventional reporting ofhours
without any consideration of overlaps.
The average active family care density for the time in which someone is participating
in an activity with a child is .46. That is, there is about one adult family member per two
children on average. The active parental care density index is lower, at .39. In two-parent
families, the average parental care density is .43, significantly higher (at the 99% confidence level) than for one-parent families, at .27. Overall parental care density declines
10. Since children could be either recipients or providers of care, we looked at the frequency with which
children participated in activities together without a parent present. This amounted to only 15% of their time
(see Table 2); we treated this percentage as an upper-bound estimate of baby-sitting time and assigned 85% of
children's time to children's receipt of care. Overlap effects may not be linear. In particular, one may argue that
the presence of additional children does not "dilute" adult attention in a linear fashion.
388 Demography, Volume 42-Number 2, May 2005
markedly with the number of children, from .64 for the average child in a one-child family
to .36 for the average child in a two-child family to .29 for the average child in a family of
three or more children. In other words, parental active care is spread most "thickly" when
there are two parents and only one child and most "thinly" when there is only one parent
and several children.
CONCLUSION
This analysis has pointed to the limitations of previous measures of family care. Measures of passive care have ignored large components of supervisory time when young
children are sleeping and smaller periods when no adult is actually listed as "available."
Measures of active care have devoted little attention to the role of family caregivers
other than parents or to overlaps between caregivers and children. Our analysis of the
PSID-CDS offers a more accurate and disaggregated view of both passive and active
care. Time that young children spend sleeping or without any adult available amounts to
a significant proportion of their week. Adult relatives are important providers of active
care, and parents often engage jointly in activities with more than one child at a time.
Average care density varies considerably, depending on the number of parents and the
number of children.
Trends in average hours of parental care may give a misleading impression of the
overall quantity and quality of family time. Several studies have shown that maternal
time in activities with children aged 17 or younger has increased in the United States over
periods in which maternal labor force participation has increased (Bianchi 2000; Robinson
and Godbey 1997; Sandberg and Hofferth 2001; Sayer, Bianchi, and Robinson 2004). It is
important to remember that such a trend, however important, may have been accompanied by a reduction in maternal supervisory time, a decrease in care time provided by
grandmothers or older siblings, and/or a decrease in care density.
The time that mothers spend in activities with children represents only a small share
of the total supervisory responsibilities and time constraints that should be considered
"care." These activities, which can be shifted to evenings and weekends, are more flexible than basic supervisory responsibilities. Mothers and fathers can reallocate their time
in ways that reduce overlap but increase the stress of care. Declines in the availability or
willingness of other relatives to provide active care may put pressure on mothers to increase their efforts to compensate for what would otherwise represent a decline in total
family time (McDonald and Armstrong 2001). Such trends could help explain why parenting is perceived as an increasingly demanding task.
The measurement of care time also has implications for the monetary value of family
time devoted to children (Folbre 2004). Estimates of the opportunity cost of parental time
should be based on the total number of hours that parents spend with children, since both
parents are sacrificing potential market income or leisure. On the other hand, estimates of
the replacement cost of parental time should be based only on nonoverlapping time because, in most cases, children do not require the passive or active care of more than one
adult at a time. The monetary value of unpaid care by relatives deserves more attention
than it has yet received.
Time diaries are valuable tools for analyzing the temporal demands of care for dependents. But these tools are only as strong as the concepts on which they are based. The
design of diaries should follow the example of the PSID-CDS in collecting data that are
relevant to overlaps in both the provision and receipt of active care. Diaries should also
move beyond activity-based categories to distinguish among several types of passive care.
Ethnographic observation and focus groups, in which respondents have an opportunity to
discuss the experience "behind the numbers," could also improve the interpretation of
survey data (Bittman et al. 2004). Family time is an important resource that requires careful measurement.
